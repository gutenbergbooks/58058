<h3 id="HISTORICAL_INTRODUCTION">HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION, AND PLAN OF THE WORK.</h3>

<p>On the night of the 10th of January, in the
year 1838, the inhabitants of London—those
especially residing in the heart of the city—were
alarmed by a cry expressive or prophetic
of calamity or peril.—<span class="smcap">The Royal Exchange</span>
<em>was in flames</em>! Feelings and sentiments were
excited by the occurrence different from those
produced by an ordinary conflagration. The
Royal Exchange was one of the great public
buildings of the metropolis; it was the third
too which, within a very short period, had met
with a similar fate. It was not only the monument
of individual munificence, the gift to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
city which he had adorned and served, of an
eminent merchant,—a man of talents, goodness,
learning, and largeness of heart; it was the
central point in the British empire for the
meeting of the men of all nations; the palace
of trade; the place of commercial congress;
the hall in which assembled from day to day
the “merchant princes” of England, and the
representatives of the traffic and the wealth of
the world. The flames spread; the devouring
element secured to itself the entire edifice; it
fed upon and consumed floor and roof, picture
and statue, destroying or defacing everything it
touched, till the whole building was reduced to
ashes, and nothing remained of it but smouldering
ruins.</p>

<p>In a little time a new edifice was projected,
larger and more magnificent than the former,
and thus better fitted to meet the wants of the
age, and to indicate the progress and advancement
of society. The first stone was laid by
the youthful husband of our young queen,—one
might almost say the young bridegroom
of a royal bride,—and the building rose with
comparative rapidity, unfolding and embodying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
its great idea. As it approached completion,
and its front was to be adorned by some significant
figures or allegorical device, questions
arose as to whether an inscription should be
placed there with them, and as to what that
inscription should be. The illustrious individual
who had laid the first stone of the structure
suggested for that inscription a simple text
from the English Bible, “<span class="smcap">The earth is the
Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.</span>” The
suggestion was adopted; it was carried into
effect; and hence there may be read, on the
front of our Royal Exchange, and read in our
land’s language,—but addressed to all men;
for they are addressed not only to the British
merchant, but to the representatives of every
nation under heaven,—the few plain words
which have just been repeated,—</p>

<div class="bbox-small">
<p class="center"><span class="larger">THE EARTH IS</span><br />
THE LORD’S,<br />
AND THE FULNESS<br />
THEREOF.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Words, however, these, which, while simple in
appearance, are pregnant and suggestive in the
highest degree; for they are full to overflowing,
of great practical divine thoughts.</p>

<p>The suggestion of this inscription for the
Royal Exchange was the suggestion not only
of sound judgment and good sense, but of
piety, humility, and religious faith. It attributes
nothing to any individual; it proclaims
no national or municipal greatness; it breathes
no flattery to monarch, merchant, class, or
kingdom:—it is simply a devout recognition
of Almighty God, “from whom, and by whom,
and for whom are all things:”—who created
the world, and adorned and beautified it; who
covered it with verdure, made it fruitful, fills
it with its various products, and sustains it
for the service of man. It is a great thing
to have this public recognition of the Most
High made, as it were, every hour of every
day, from the very centre of all mundane and
secular activities;—it is a stirring recollection,
that that very building, thought by many to
be the temple of Mammon, should stand forth
as a preacher and teacher on behalf of God;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and, <em>still more so</em>, that its English voice should
be distinctly heard above the din and discord
of its many languages, perpetually proclaiming
to its busy multitudes, and the busy multitudes
of the whole city, what, if practically pondered,
would cool avarice, prevent fraud, moderate
ambition, inspire truth, dictate justice, make
every man feel as a brother to his fellow, and
all nations, ranks, and conditions of men, as
the members of one vast and undivided confraternity.</p>

<p>It is interesting to think that the same
illustrious Prince who suggested the inscription
for the Royal Exchange, originated the idea of
the Exhibition of the industry of all nations.
It is to the honour of England, that the first
time that the whole world, so to speak, comes
together for a peaceful purpose, the meeting
takes place in the British metropolis; and it
is to the honour of the husband of England’s
Queen, not only that he should have been the
father of <em>this</em> thought, but that by a previous
one he should have attempted, as it were, to
sanctify industry, and trade, and commerce, and
manufactures, by an open recognition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
providence of God as the source of them all.
It is worth living for, to be, first, the occasion
of a great central commercial edifice, in one of
the greatest cities of the world, bearing on its
front the record of the central truth of religion;
and then, secondly, to be the cause of the
congregating together, in that city, of men of
all lands and of all languages, to look, among
other things, upon that edifice, and to observe
the truth which the people it represents have
there publicly enthroned!</p>

<p>The writer of the following pages proposes,
then, to unite in his reflections the two things
which, through the agency of the same mind,
are thus already united in fact—the <span class="smcap">Inscription</span>
on the Royal Exchange, and <span class="smcap">the Exhibition
of the Industry of all Nations</span>. He intends,
in the first part, to point out and illustrate
the great primary religious truths which are
involved in the announcement of the inscription
itself. As it, however, is the first verse of a
psalm, he purposes, in the second part, to
look at it in connexion with the whole of the
psalm, and at the psalm in connexion with
the whole of Revelation, and thus to bring out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and associate with the inscription additional
ideas of both truth and duty. Then, supposing
the whole series of these truths and duties to
be earnestly adopted and practically exemplified
by all nations—by England herself, and by those
to whom they will be virtually presented on their
meeting together in the British metropolis—it
is proposed, in the last part, to describe what,
on such a supposition, would be the coming
future of Europe and of the world.</p>

<h3 id="I_I">I.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Divine Existence and Personality.</i></span></h3>

<p>The first idea suggested by the words of
the inscription is the existence of God: “<em>The
earth is the Lord’s.</em>” It is here assumed that
there is a God; and it is further assumed that
God is a person. He is the possessor and
proprietor of the world: he has an existence
distinct from it: he is capable of looking upon
it, and of regarding it as his own: “The
earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof;
the <em>world, and they that dwell therein</em>.” Not
only is the material structure his, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
living inhabitants; and not only those of inferior
rank, but the Lord and Master of them
all. The same being that claims “the fowls
of the mountains, the wild beasts of the field
and the forest, and the cattle upon a thousand
hills,” claims also to be the proprietor of <em>man</em>,
the source and sovereign of the intelligent
universe;—“all souls are mine.” God is not
nature, nor nature God. God and the universe
are not one and the same thing. He is not a
force, a power, a law; he is not attraction,
electricity, or any of the great active material
agents, or all of them put together: he is not
necessity, chance, fate: he is not a thing, nor
the sum of things, but a person: he is a
mind, with faculties, affections, character, and
is as distinct from the “earth” and the
“world” as a man is distinct from a house
or a clock, or anything whatever that he can
call <em>his</em>.</p>

<p>The personality of God—his existence as an
intelligent agent distinct from the universe,—is
destructive of all theories of atheism and pantheism;
of the philosophy which teaches that
there is no God at all, and of that which teaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
that all things are God. The two systems,
indeed, are essentially one; they are alike opposed
to the existence of religion, and render
faith and piety impossible. A principle is proclaimed
in the words before us,—words ceaselessly
uttered, and uttered to all men, from the
commercial centre of this great city,—which
repels and repudiates a godless philosophy, in
whatever form it may be held or taught—by
whatever name it may be indicated or concealed.</p>

<p>The truth thus referred to, the foundation
truth of all religion, is taught and illustrated
in the Holy Scriptures in the most remarkable
manner. The Bible, indeed, seldom or never
attempts to <em>prove</em> that there is a God; it rather
assumes his existence, takes it for granted, proceeds
upon it as a necessary intuitional truth,
and regards any one who would pretend to
deny it, either as “a fool” who is prompted to
the denial by his corrupt “heart;” or as a philosopher
who has become “vain in his reasonings,”
and whose “understanding is darkened.”
While, however, the Bible starts with the acknowledgment
of God, and proceeds throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
on the recognition of his existence, it occasionally
illustrates his personality, supremacy,
distinctness from the universe and correlative
truths, in a way which is at once adapted
to confirm these views where they are admitted,—to
demonstrate them to those that doubt,—and
to cover with contempt idolaters or sophists
by whom they may be denied.</p>

<p>Two or three scriptural passages may be
quoted here, in support or illustration of
this statement. Let it be remembered then,
that the Scriptures always ascribe to God <em>personal</em>
attributes. He is “a God of knowledge.”
His “understanding is infinite.” He acts “according
to the council of his will.” He is
“holy,” “just,” “good,” “pure;” He loves
and hates, observes and remembers, approves
and condemns, punishes and rewards. His personal
omniscience, and consequent independence
of all other beings, is powerfully asserted
by Isaiah:—“Who hath directed the Spirit of
the Lord, or being his counsellor hath taught
<em>him</em>? With whom took he counsel, and who
instructed him, and taught him in the path of
judgment, and taught him knowledge, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
showed to him the way of understanding?”
But the personality of God, and his distinct
existence from the universe, are sometimes
united together in a very striking way. He is
referred to as the Creator—the source whence
all things have proceeded; and then, on the
principle that <em>what there is in the effect there
must first have been in the cause, and must
continue to be in an existing cause</em>, his personal
properties are argued from the fact that such
properties actually exist,—exist, that is, in
men,—beings whom he has made: “He that
planted the ear, shall not <em>he</em> hear? he that
formed the eye, shall not <em>he</em> see? … he that
teacheth man knowledge, shall not <em>he</em> know?”
The same argument, in another form, is used
by the apostle Paul, when reasoning with the
philosophers of Athens. Having referred to
God as the Creator of the world; as giving “to
all life, and breath, and all things;” and as
“having made all nations of men that dwell on
the face of the earth;”—having illustrated his
position by the saying of one of their own
poets,—“we are also his offspring,”—he proceeds
to argue thus:—“forasmuch then, as <em>we</em> are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
offspring of God, we ought not to think that
the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or
stone, graven by art and man’s device:” in
other words, “seeing that <em>we</em> have thought,
intelligence, and will,—that we have affections,
consciousness, personality,—and seeing that we
are the creatures of God, and must have
derived from <em>him</em> whatsoever we possess, it is
absurd to think of him as <em>im</em>personal, material,
unintelligent, since he must certainly have in
himself what he has been able to confer.”
There is great force in this form of putting
the truth as it is put both by the prophet and
the apostle. To ordinary common sense, it
would seem to be demonstrative. It appears
so natural to infer that the great parent of
<em>persons</em> must <em>be</em> a person;—that the source of
thought must be able to think;—that the
fountain whence flows to the intelligent universe,
faculty and affection, reason and will,
must possess these in infinite plenitude in
itself;—it would appear so natural to reason thus,
and so obvious, as almost to render reference
to it superfluous, were it not that it is now
fashionable to think of the universe as a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
machine, and God as the central and pervading
force, and that this machine, in the course
of its ceaseless and everlasting action, and in
the process of its varied movements from eternity,
has happened, or contrived, to grind out
<em>thought</em> along with other things, and to fill
worlds with persons (or what seem to be
such) as well as with form and colour, and
the different objects of material existence! In
reference to such a theory, we may appropriately
adopt the words of the psalmist, which
stand in immediate connexion with those already
quoted. “Understand, ye brutish among the
people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?—The
Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that
they are vanity.”</p>

<h3 id="I_II">II.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Creation.</i></span></h3>

<p>But the words of the Inscription, read in
connexion with the second verse of the psalm
from which it is taken, further illustrate the
ideas adverted to—God’s existence, personality,
and distinction from the universe—by placing
the fact of his ownership of the earth, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
previous fact of his having created it. “The
earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the
world, and they that dwell therein. For <em>he hath
founded it upon the seas, and established it upon
the floods</em>.”</p>

<p>God is thus distinctly recognised as the
Creator of all things, and as hence becoming,
or being, their proprietor, by necessary consequence.
That the universe is a creation, in the
most strict and literal sense of the word, is the
teaching of the Bible;—a truth which, while
leading to that of his universal proprietorship of
the earth and the world, as necessarily implies
and strikingly illustrates his own distinct independence
and personality: “Through faith we
understand that the worlds were framed by the
word of God, so that things which are seen were
not made of things which do appear.” The
meaning of this statement is, that visible objects—that
is, the whole visible universe—did not
<em>originally</em> spring out of visible materials. However
long might be the periods, during which
the substance of the earth was undergoing preparatory
processes, previous to the appearance
of its destined inhabitant, there was a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
when that substance was <em>not</em>. There was a
period when the Eternal lived alone,—when
space was literally infinite, except as filled and
pervaded by <em>him</em>,—when nothing material anywhere
existed, by which any portion of space
could be inclosed or limited. In that mysterious
solitude, God was as much a personality,—as
much a mind with thought and will,—as he is
now. He could not then be confounded with
his works, for his works were not; and he ought
not now to be confounded with them because
they <em>are</em>. It is possible to conceive of all the
suns and systems that exist, as being swept
away into utter nothingness, and yet to understand
that God might continue in all the fulness
of his being and perfections. “In the beginning,”—at
some period in the immeasurable
depths of the abyss of that eternity which is
the dwelling-place of Deity, God exerted the act
of creation, and gave birth to what we call
matter, which, in the revolutions of ages, he
framed and fashioned into separate worlds. The
Lord was, “<em>before</em> his works of old.” He was
“from everlasting, <em>or ever the earth was</em>.”
“When there were no depths,” he existed;—“before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the mountains and hills,—while as yet
he hath not made the earth, nor the fields, nor
(even) the dust (or matter) of the world.” This
is the sublime and awful truth which the Scriptures
teach as to the primary relation of God
to the universe, and on the ground of which
they ascribe to him successive acts of formative
power,—often in language highly figurative, but
always meant to convey the idea of the exercise
of the wisdom, goodness, foresight, and similar
attributes of a <em>personal</em> agent in the Maker of
the world.</p>

<p>“Before the mountains were brought forth,
or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the
world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou
art God.” “He prepared the heavens, he set
a compass upon the face of the depth. He
established the clouds above, he strengthened
the foundations of the deep. He gave to the
sea his decree, that the waters should not pass
his commandment.” “He stretcheth out the
north over the empty place, and hangeth the
earth upon nothing.” He is “the great God
that formed all things.” “O Lord, how manifold
are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
all.” “The Lord by wisdom hath founded
the earth, by understanding hath he established
the heavens. By his knowledge the depths are
broken up, and the clouds drop down dew.”
“Of old thou hast laid the foundation of the
earth; and the heavens are the work of thy
hands” “The sea is his,—he made it; and
his hands formed the dry land.” “Mine hand
hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my
right hand hath spanned the heavens.” “Lift
up your eyes on high, and behold who hath
created these things, that bringeth out their
host by number: he calleth them all by names
by the greatness of his might, for that he
is strong in power; not one faileth.” “Who
hath measured the waters in the hollow of his
hand, and meted out heaven with the span,
and comprehended the dust of the earth in a
measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
and the hills in a balance?” “<em>I</em> have made
the earth—the man and the beast that are upon
the ground, by my great power and by my out-stretched
arm.” “Where wast thou when I
laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if
thou hast understanding. Whereupon are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the
corner-stone thereof? Hast thou commanded
the morning since thy days; and caused the
day-spring to know his place? Hast thou
entered into the springs of the sea? Hast
thou perceived the breadth of the earth?
Where is the way where light dwelleth? And
as for darkness, where is the place thereof?
Canst <em>thou</em> bind the sweet influence of
Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season,
or guide Arcturus with his sons? Who hath
put wisdom into the inward parts? or who hath
given understanding to the heart?” “There is
a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the
Almighty giveth them understanding.” God
made “man in his own image.” He is “the
Father of spirits.” “The heavens declare his
glory, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.”
“That which may be known of God is
manifest” to men, “for God hath showed it unto
them. For the invisible things of him from
the creation of the world are clearly seen, being
understood by the things that are made, even
his eternal power and Godhead;” so that men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
are “without excuse,” if, knowing God, or not
liking “to retain God in their knowledge,” they
“worship him not as God,” but, “professing
themselves to be wise, become fools,” changing
“the truth of God into a lie.”</p>

<p>Such are some of the statements of Scripture
respecting the creation of the world and man.
To admit these, it is not necessary to deny the
revelations of science as to the physical antiquity
of the globe, and the successive phenomena that
distinguished the history of the pre-adamite
earth. There might have been then a wonderful
series of gradual developments, and various
material and animal formations;—the point to be
kept in view is, that all these were <em>intelligently
presided over</em> by the Author of nature; and that
they all followed in obedience to laws, which <em>he</em> not
only ordained, but <em>administered</em>. The “Crystal
Palace” is the embodiment of an idea conceived
and perfected in a personal intelligence. It has
been constructed and reared by rule and compass,
measure and weight, and according to the
suggestions of wisdom and skill. All the variety
of its extraordinary contents bear the impress
of thought and purpose, design and contrivance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
faculty and power; but no one confounds the
work with the workmen, or imagines that the
skill impressed on the productions is something
inherent in the productions themselves, or that
they have sprung, by necessity, from the impulse
or operation of unintelligent force! Any
one who saw the apparently confused and chaotic
jumble of coarse packages and unarranged materials,
as they lay about the building, previous to
being put into harmonious order, could never
have imagined that they had in themselves any
tendency to take the places and assume the
appearances to which they were destined, independently
of the mind, the thought, plan, reason,
and ability of the person or persons by whom
all was to be effected. Even if it had been possible
to conceive such a thing,—to conceive,
namely, that they should, without the immediate
agency of hands, have gradually arranged themselves
into beautiful groups, and that <em>thus</em> confusion
was to be succeeded by order,—this would
only have been regarded as the result of processes
to which they had been subjected by
human sagacity, and as the proof of profounder
and more wonderful contrivance on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the presiding genius of the scene. Instead of
tempting a thoughtful observer to confound and
identify the thing done with the actual doer,—or
to lose sight of him, and to attribute all to
necessity or chance, or to some mysterious appetencies
in the things themselves,—it would only
have carried the idea of personality further back,
and have augmented his admiration of the attributes
that distinguished it. In the same way,
adhering to the truth that the heavens and the
earth are an actual creation, then, whatever may
have been the processes through which they
gradually passed till the whole fabric was developed
and perfected, <em>all was the work of a personal
agent distinct from the actual universe itself</em>, and
all that was done was accomplished through the
action of those laws which he framed,—to which
he subjected them,—which he administered,—which
the things did not originate,—which they
could not understand, and from which they
could not escape. <em>He</em>—the living, spiritual,
personal God—was the Mover and Maker, the
Designer and Doer from first to last. In the
same way, just as nothing can be more completely
a man’s own than that which is the product<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of his own skill, when acting independently,
and operating on his justly obtained material,
so nothing can be such a proof of the proprietorship
of God in the universe and its inhabitants,
as that by him they were all alike “created and
made.” “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness
thereof; the world, and they that dwell
therein. <em>For he hath founded it upon the seas,
and hath established it upon the floods.</em>”</p>

<h3 id="I_III">III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Providence.</i></span></h3>

<p>The idea suggested by the words of the
inscription, of the “<span class="smcapuc">FULNESS</span>” of the earth belonging
to God, deserves a distinct and specific
consideration.</p>

<p>By the “<em>fulness</em>” of the earth, we understand
all that it contains of raw material capable of
being subjected to human skill, and all that it
produces, of whatever sort, animal or vegetable,
for the service of men,—for the sustenance of
sentient nature,—for happiness, or glory and
beauty. By all this being God’s, by this “fulness
of the earth” belonging to <em>him</em>, we understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that it is to be attributed to him as its
Author; that he originally deposited, in the
depths of the mountains and the womb of the
world, their mineral wealth; that he covered
the earth with verdure and fruitfulness, and filled
the air, the sea, and the field with their numerous
inhabitants; that he established the laws
by which there should be a constant succession
in all the varieties of animal and vegetable
nature; and that he so <em>superintends</em> the whole
arrangement, and <em>personally</em> administers these
laws, that all that they produce may be properly
regarded as the <em>immediate</em> product of his power
and skill. “Fulness,” so produced, is <em>his</em>, “<em>from</em>
whom and <em>by</em> whom” it comes, with scarcely less
emphasis than if it was to be spoken into being
in the “twinkling of an eye,”—at the utterance
of a single word, or by a sudden act of omnipotent
volition.</p>

<p>The inhabitants, then, of this great city are
reminded every day, as they look up at the front
of their Royal Exchange, not only of the existence
and personality of God, and of his being the
proprietor of all things, but of his being <em>this</em>, by
<em>his continued providence and government of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
world</em>, as well as by his having created it at first.
It was God that for ages wrought in secret,
constructing the rocks and consolidating the
mountains, depositing the useful and precious
metals, spreading the coal-field, and preparing
materials of every sort for future society. It
was he who commanded “the dry land to
appear,” and the waters to be gathered into
seas: who covered the earth “with the grass
of the field, and with the herb yielding seed,
and the fruit tree yielding fruit;” who fixed
the sun in the heavens, and gave him to the
world for cheerful light and genial warmth;
who “spread abroad the clouds,” and “caused
rain,” and established the laws of vegetable production:
it was God who caused the waters to
be filled “with the moving creature that hath
life;” that caused “the fowl to fly above the
earth in the open firmament of heaven;” and
that made “the beast of the earth after his
kind, and cattle, and everything that creepeth
upon the earth;”—it was God that gave to them
the law “to increase and multiply, and to fill
the earth;” and then gave the earth to the
children of men, and commanded them, too, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
only “to increase and multiply and to replenish
the earth,” but “to have dominion over the
fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth.” It was God who “made of one blood
all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of
the earth,” and who, as “the Most High, who
ruleth over the children of men, and doeth as
he will with the inhabitants of the earth,”
“separated the sons of Adam, and divided to
the nations their inheritance,” and “determined
their appointed times, and the bounds of their
habitation.” It was God who appropriated to
different climes their diversified productions;—who
hid beneath the surface of various peoples
mineral varieties;—who conferred on the nations
different talents and different tastes;—who made
exchange of productions a mutual want, necessity,
or convenience;—and who thus established
the law of commercial intercourse. It was God
that gave to man improvable reason, so that he
was not bound down to unintelligent instinct in
constructing his habitation or providing for his
necessities, but was empowered and intrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
with the inventive head and the skilful hand;
could become the accomplished and cunning
artificer, so that out of the raw material of the
world he could call forth new appearances and
forms of things, and thus cover the earth with
another creation! It was God who appointed
wood to swim, and water to flow, and fixed the
poles, and fashioned the loadstone, and gave the
compass, and bound the breast of the first mariners
as with triple brass, that all the wonders of
navigation might ensue, and enterprise and discovery,
and the peaceful and profitable intercourse
of nations. And it is God that still presides
over and governs all things; that gives spring
and summer, and winter and harvest; it is he
who distils the influences of the heavens, and
perpetuates the fertility of the earth; it is he
who gives annual abundance, and causes all
nations, the world over, to rejoice in what comes
to them as if it were a new and instant creation,—a
gift and gratuity dropped from the sky!
It is God “that gives to man power to get
wealth,” and that confers on the nations their
respective tastes and distinctive genius,—their
capacity for labour, or their love of the beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
or their skilful handicraft, or their omnipotent
enterprise, or their gigantic achievements! It
is God that thus makes them useful to each
other;—that binds them together from the very
circumstance of their separate gifts and their
mutual necessities;—and that imparts to them
an interest in each other’s industry, from the
different forms and uses that it takes;—and it
is he, we trust, who is bringing them together
to the <span class="smcap">Great Exhibition</span>, so that, while they
wonder at the result, the vastness and the variety
of their own doings, they may acknowledge <em>Him</em>,
to whom they are indebted for material and
skill, time and capacity, life and all things;—<em>whose</em>
they themselves are;—from whom cometh
every good and every perfect gift; and, as <em>whose
property</em>, all that they possess should be held
and used. “The earth is the Lord’s, and the
fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell
therein.”</p>

<p>The propriety of thus attributing everything
to God, and of recognising his providence in the
laws of the world, the productions of the seasons,
the results of industry, the instruments of commerce,
and even in the adornments of civilization,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and the allowable luxuries of elegance and refinement,
and also in the gifts of invention, subtlety,
and mechanical skill,—all this is so frequently
taught or referred to in Scripture, that a few
appropriate illustrative passages may with great
propriety be inserted here.</p>

<p>The attentive reader will notice that the several
quotations that follow illustrate the most of the
ideas that have been advanced, and that they do
this very much in the order in which they have
been given. The first passage, from the Book
of Job, we give in the language of Mr. Goode’s
translation, as it expresses the sense of the
original, with some approach to scientific exactness.</p>

<p>“Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a
bed for the gold which men refine. Iron is dug
up from the earth, and the rock poureth forth
copper. Man delveth into the region of darkness,
and examineth to the utmost limit the
stones of darkness and death-shade: he breaketh
up the veins from the matrice, which, though
nothing thought of under the foot, are drawn
forth, are brandished among mankind. The
earth of itself poureth forth bread, but below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
it windeth a fiery region. Sapphires are its
stones, and gold is its ground.”</p>

<p>The following sentences, while forming part
of an argument respecting moral and spiritual
wisdom,—the fear of God and departure from
evil,—are remarkable as an enumeration of
valuable substances, and are here quoted simply
as such.</p>

<p>“But where shall wisdom be found, and where
is the place of understanding? It cannot be
“gotten for gold,” nor “silver;” it cannot be
valued with “the gold of Ophir,” “the precious
onyx,” or “the sapphire;” “gold” and “crystal”
cannot equal it; nor “coral,” nor “pearls;” nor
“the topaz of Ethiopia;” for “the price of
wisdom is above rubies.”</p>

<p>When we rise from the cavern and the mine,
from noticing the precious metals and precious
stones, and look abroad on the surface of the
earth, or upwards to the sky, or over the great
and wide sea, the Scripture meets us with innumerable
utterances of what, if we are wise, we
shall see there of the ever present, active, and
beneficent God. “He causeth the grass to
grow for the cattle, and herb for the service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of man: that he may bring forth food out of
the earth; and wine that maketh glad the
heart of man, and oil to make his face to
shine, and bread that strengtheneth man’s
heart.” “He sendeth the springs into the
valleys, which run among the hills. They give
drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
quench their thirst. By them shall the fowls
of the heaven have their habitation, that sing
among the branches. He watereth the hills
from his chambers: the earth is filled with the
fruit of his works.” “The trees of the Lord
are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon which
he hath planted.” “Thou makest darkness
and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the
forest do creep forth. The young lions roar
after their prey, and seek their meat from God.”
“The earth is full of thy riches: so is this
great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
innumerable, both small and great beasts.
These wait all upon thee, that thou mayest
give them their meat in due season. That thou
givest them they gather: thou openest thine
hand, they are filled with good. Thou hidest
thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created:
and thou renewest the face of the earth. The
glory of the Lord shall endure for ever; the
Lord shall rejoice in his works.” He is “the
confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of
them that are afar off upon the sea.” He “by
his strength setteth fast the mountains, being
girded with power:” He “stilleth the noise of
the waves, and the tumult of the people.”
“Thou makest the outgoings of the morning
and of the evening to rejoice. Thou visitest
the earth and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest
it with the river of God, which is full of water:
thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so
provided for it. Thou waterest the ridges
thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows
thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou
blessest the springing thereof. Thou crownest
the year with thy goodness; and thy paths
drop fatness. They drop upon the pastures of
the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on
every side. The pastures are clothed with flocks;
the valleys also are covered over with corn; they
shout for joy, they also sing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>In the following passages, the various powers
and capacities of humanity, as displayed in
agriculture and art, are represented as Divine
gifts. The farmer and mechanic, the designer
and manufacturer, the engraver and draftsman,
the worker in metals, in wood, stone, and in
every sort of raw material, all accomplish their
several operations in virtue of ability which God
confers. “Give ye ear, and hear my voice;
hearken, and hear my speech. Doth the
ploughman plough all day to sow? Doth he
open and break the clods of his ground?
When he hath made plain the face thereof,
doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter
the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat
and the appointed barley and the rye in their
place? For <span class="smcapuc">GOD</span> <em>doth instruct him to discretion,
and doth teach him</em>. This also cometh forth from
the Lord of hosts, which is wonderful in council,
and excellent in working.” “And the Lord
spake unto Moses, saying, See, I have called by
name Bezaleel, the son of Uri;—and I have
filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom,
and in understanding, and in knowledge, and
in all manner of workmanship, to devise cunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
works, to work in gold, and in silver, and
in brass, and in cutting of stones, and to set
them, and in carving of timber, to work in
all manner of workmanship. And I, behold, I
have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach;—and,
in the hearts of <em>all that are wise-hearted</em>
I have put wisdom, that they may
make all that I have commanded thee.” And
Hiram, king of Tyre, sent also to Solomon “a
cunning man, endued with prudence and understanding,—skilful
to work in gold, and silver,
in brass, in iron, in stone, in timber, in purple,
in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson;
also to grave any manner of engraving, and
to find out every device that might be put to
him.”</p>

<p>The next quotations illustrate commercial intercourse,
the dependence of nation on nation,
trade by sea, and the importation of natural
curiosities, as well as of valuable products and
useful material, with other kindred matters.
“The Lord gave Solomon wisdom,—and there
was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and
they two made a league together:” and Solomon
wrote to Hiram, “Thou knowest that there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
not among us any that can skill to hew
timber like the Sidonians. Now, therefore, let
thy servants hew me cedar-trees out of Lebanon,
and unto thee will I give hire for thy
servants, according to all that thou shalt appoint.”
And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying,
“I have considered the things which thou
sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire,
concerning timber of cedar, and concerning
timber of fir. My servants shall bring them
down from Lebanon to the sea; and I will convey
them by sea in floats, to the place that thou
shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be
discharged there, and thou shalt receive them:
and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving
food for my household. So Hiram gave Solomon
cedar-trees and fir-trees; and Solomon gave
Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
food to his household, and twenty measures of
pure oil.”</p>

<p>And Solomon “went to Ezion-geber, and to
Eloth, at the sea-side, in the land of Edom.
And Hiram sent him by the hands of his
servants ships, and servants <em>that had knowledge
of the sea</em>; and they went with the servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four
hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought
it to king Solomon:” “and once every three
years came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold,
and silver, and ivory, and apes, and peacocks.”
The 27th chapter of Ezekiel is one of the most
extraordinary descriptions that is anywhere to
be met with, of the exchange of commodities
and the intercourse of nations by means of commerce.
The different productions of various
peoples and climes are enumerated; the “fulness”
of all lands is represented as flowing into
the markets of Tyre,—brought there by the ships
and sailors of every maritime nation;—while Tyre
itself is spoken of as the nurse of mariners and
the mistress of the sea,—her beauty and abundance
radiant and wonderful,—and her merchant
princes as the lords of the world. All this
may breed luxury, foster pride, promote corruption,
and lead ultimately to national degradation
and decay: but this is not the <em>necessary</em>
effect of abundance, nor does it forbid us
to refer riches, prosperity, commerce, manufactures,
and everything else that adorns life, to
the beneficence of God. “The earth is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Lord’s, and <em>the fulness thereof</em>.” HE pours
down, year by year, the riches of the skies,—calls
up the treasures of the earth, spreads
abroad the abundance of the seas,—adds to the
value of many of his gifts what they derive
from the labour, skill, and ingenuity of man,—and
excites the nations to exchange and trade,
that each country may share in the joy and
the productions of all. In this way it comes
to pass, that <em>the whole race</em>, in relation to <em>the
entire world</em>, might be addressed in the language
of Moses to the chosen people when he
described the land promised to their fathers.
“The Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good
land; a land of brooks of water, of fountains
and depths that spring out of valleys and hills:
a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and
fig-trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive-oil
and honey; a land wherein thou shalt eat
bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack
anything in it; a land whose stones are iron,
and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.”
“Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the
precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for
the deep that coucheth beneath, and for the precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
fruits brought forth by the sun, and for
the precious things put forth by the moon,
and for the chief things of the ancient mountains,
and for the precious things of the lasting
hills, and for the precious things of <em>the
earth</em> <span class="smcapuc">AND FULNESS THEREOF</span>, and for the good
will of Him that dwelt in the bush.” “He
made Jacob to ride on the high places of the
earth, that he might eat the increase of the
fields; and he made him to suck honey out
of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;
butter of kine and milk of sheep, with fat of
lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and
goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and
he drank the pure blood of the grape.”</p>

<p>Unusual as some of these expressions are,
especially those of a figurative character, they
may be taken to indicate the intention of Providence
to bless the obedient in “the life that
now is,” as well as in relation to that “which is
to come.” “God giveth us all things richly to
enjoy;” if faith and piety, love and obedience,
pervaded the race, everything that adorns and
beautifies existence might be delighted in and
used without injury. By free and universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
commercial intercourse, the abundance and blessings
of favoured regions may become the
common property of all. There may thus be
established throughout all nations, an equality of
privilege, each sharing in the productions of the
rest. With such views, we may appropriately
conclude the present chapter by the following
passages, weaving them into a song for the entire
race:</p>

<h2>PART II.<br />
<span class="smaller">INFERENTIAL.</span></h2>

<p>So far we have been employed in elucidating
the principles which are involved in the terms of
the inscription—which is enthroned in the front
of the Royal Exchange,—<span class="smcap">The earth is the
Lord’s, and the fulness thereof</span>. These
words, taken alone, distinctly recognise the existence
of God, Creation, and Providence. They
express, or imply, through their own inherent
and independent force, the acknowledgment of
these great primary truths. In the course of
our remarks, we have glanced at one or two of
the clauses of the psalm immediately succeeding
the words of the inscription; rather, however,
as illustrative of the extent of its significance,
than as bringing to it any additional thought.
We now propose to take the acknowledgment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
“The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof,”
in connexion <em>with the whole psalm of which it
is the commencement, and the psalm itself in
connexion with the whole revelation of which it
is a part</em>; and thus to bring out those additional
forms of both truth and duty, which the
<em>scriptural</em> recognition of God’s existence and
government, and his general relations to the
world and man, may come to suggest to a devout
and reflective Christian observer.</p>

<h3 id="II_I">I.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Worship.</i></span></h3>

<p>Immediately after the assertion of God’s proprietorship
of the world and man, the psalmist
inquires, “Who shall ascend into the hill of the
Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?”
Language this, which refers to the locality and
the uses of the temple, as the appointed place of
Divine service. The existence of God and the
obligation to worship him, would seem to be
associated by an indissoluble necessity. The two
ideas, indeed, mutually involve and illustrate
each other. Admit the Divine existence; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
felt to extend downwards into the domain
of human duty, and to suggest and enforce
the obligation of worship: admit the reality of
the religious instinct, and mark its universal
and irrepressible force,—it swells upwards and
amounts to a proof of the existence of God.
The Divine Being has not only set his glory
above the heavens, and spoken of himself by the
myriads of voices that are perpetually issuing
from the earth and the sky; he has not only
stamped his image and superscription on the
personal and intellectual attributes of the race;
but he has provided an unimpeachable witness
for himself, in the religious constitution of
human nature. If there is one thing more than
another which forms the peculiar distinction of
man, and which places him in secluded and solitary
grandeur apart from all the tribes of sentient
existence by which he is surrounded, it is
his possession and consciousness of a religious
capacity. It may show itself in grotesque or
disgusting forms,—it may blunder in its search,
and babble in its utterances,—it may even become
ferocious and malignant in its character;
but <em>there</em> it is, <em>in</em> man, and in him alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
manifested everywhere, active always, forming a
palpable and <em>impassable</em> distinction between his
nature and that of all other creatures. The lower
animals have senses and appetites similar to his;
they can see and hear—they hunger and thirst;
in many of them, indeed, some of the things
that he and they possess in common, exist in
greater acuteness and perfection in <em>them</em> than
they do in him; while others make approaches to
thought and reason, memory and will, affection
and passion; but none of them share with him
the capacity to adore,—none of them can pray,—none
but he can entertain the conception of
an invisible power,—engage in individual, or
unite in acts of social, devotion. It is the prerogative
of man to be able to say either, “Our
Father,” or “I believe.” Even if it were admitted
that specimens of humanity have been found, or
could be produced, utterly destitute of the religious
capacity, and with nothing about them,
when they gaze on the universe, beyond the
vacant stare of unintelligent natures; and even if
it were further asserted and acknowledged, that
it was utterly impossible to awaken in them a
sense or perception of anything Divine,—yet it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
would be found that <em>their children</em> could be
taught to comprehend and feel religious ideas,—that
<em>they</em> had within them the spiritual capacity,—from
which it would be evident that <em>their fathers
had originally possessed it too</em>. The religious
instinct, then, or susceptibility, or faculty, or
whatever it may be called, is inherent in human
nature—divides and distinguishes it from all else
in the wide world, though it may express itself
in the grossnesses of superstition and idolatry,
or may have sunk into dormancy in extraordinary
cases; but neither old, nor young, of all
the tribes of the inferior races,—the most sagacious
or the most domesticated,—can be found to
display, or be taught to comprehend, religion at
all!</p>

<p>It is a simple fact, then, beyond all question,
that humanity possesses this distinguishing attribute.
All things beneath and around him seem
to be made for man; but he is the subject of a
strong, active, predominating impulse, that appears
like a consciousness, on his own part, that
<em>he</em> is made for something else. This impulse
finds utterance and embodiment in religious ideas
and religious service. Now, it would be a strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
anomaly in a world like this, in which every
faculty of every creature finds its corresponding
and appropriate object,—in which wing and hoof,
scent and speed, eye and ear, hand and horn,
powers and passions, appetites and attributes of
all sorts, are fitted exactly to something that
seems to be made for <em>them</em>, or for which <em>they</em> are
made,—it would be a strange thing, that the
only exception to this law, should be in the Lord
and Master of the world himself!—and that
it should occur, too, just in that one faculty
that at once distinguishes and dignifies him more
than any other! The existence and actings of
the religious instinct in man thus constitute a
proof of the existence of God, just as the admitted
existence of God involves the obligation to religion
in man. The tendency in humanity “to feel
after God if haply it may find him,”—and to
<em>have</em> something it may call God,—whether it
succeed in finding him or not,—is demonstrative
of a Divine objective reality answerable to itself,
in the same way as the half-formed wings of a
bird in the shell are proof of the existence of an
external atmosphere, and of the ultimate destiny
of the bird itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>It is worth observing, too, that this duty of
worship, which results from the truth professed
in the acknowledgment that “the earth is
the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof,” like the
other things already mentioned, involves or
illustrates the Divine <em>personality</em>. Worship, at
the very least, is adoration and gratitude,—the
utterance, generally in words, of thought and
affection towards the Supreme Nature, as the
subject of high attributes and the source of
universal good;—exercises these, that can have
no meaning, if that nature has no consciousness
of its own perfections, and no knowledge
of the language addressed to it. For man “to
ascend into the hill of the Lord, and to stand
and worship in his holy place,” He, to whom
he approaches, must be a personal intelligence.
Worship is the communion of mind with mind,—not
only the sympathy of worshipper with
worshipper, but the communion of each and
of all with the worshipped. There can be no
communion or sympathy with <em>a force</em>;—no
intelligent adoration of a law; no affections
can be warmed and excited, and drawn forth
in psalm and song, towards a mere senseless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
physical power,—an unintelligent, mechanical
necessity! Without a personal God, everything
like worship is a mockery and a lie;
the whole service is nothing but a masquerade.
If worship could be conceived to be honestly
attempted in connexion with the denial of God’s
personal existence, it would be an attempt on
the part of the worshippers to produce subjective
states of mind by the conscious temporary
assumption of a falsehood, and the employment
upon themselves of a system of direct deception
and imposture. The thing is impossible,—or
impossible to be continued. There must either
be the admission of a personal God as the
object of worship, or worship itself will soon
cease. <em>Our</em> belief and persuasion as a people
are recorded in the front of our Royal Exchange.
We may adapt to the fact the beautiful words
of the Book of Proverbs: “Wisdom crieth
<em>without</em>; she uttereth her voice <em>in the streets</em>.
She crieth <em>in the chief place of concourse</em>; in
the <span class="smcapuc">CITY</span> she uttereth her words, saying, ‘<span class="smcap">The
earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness
thereof</span>.’” And this publicly recorded persuasion,—this
proclamation of our faith in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the ears of all men, and our meaning it for
the proclamation of the common and universal
faith of humanity,—<em>this</em> involves in it the
corresponding duty,—the duty of <em>worshipping</em>
Him who is acknowledged as God,—the God
of the whole earth,—and the duty of “<em>all</em> that
dwell therein.” “O thou that hearest prayer,
<em>unto thee shall all flesh come</em>.” “The Lord
reigneth, <em>let the earth rejoice</em>; let the multitude
of isles be glad thereof.” “Sing unto
the Lord a new song, sing unto the Lord, <em>all
the earth</em>.” “Make a joyful noise unto the
Lord, <em>all ye lands</em>. Serve the Lord with gladness:
come before his presence with singing.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and
into his courts with praise: be thankful unto
him, and bless his name.” “Oh that men
would praise the Lord for his goodness, and
for his wonderful works to <em>the children of
men</em>.” “Praise the Lord, <em>all ye nations</em>; praise
him, <em>all ye people</em>. For his merciful kindness
is great toward us: and the truth of the Lord
endureth for ever. <span class="smcap">Praise ye the Lord.</span>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="II_II">II.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Character.</i></span></h3>

<p>What stands next to the idea of worship, is a
description of the moral character of the worshippers.
“Who shall ascend into the hill of the
Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?”
“<em>He that hath clean hands and a pure heart:
who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor
sworn deceitfully.</em>” This description is very
brief, but it is very comprehensive. Each clause
may be considered as representing a distinct
and large department of duty; and the whole,
taken together, as demanding or enforcing universal
virtue. “<em>Clean hands</em>” stand as a figure
for all outward and visible excellence. Every
thing that the man <em>does</em>, is done in consistency
with the rule of rectitude. He is a just, equitable,
fair-dealing man. Confidence may be
placed in his honour and uprightness, his incorruptible
integrity, his contempt of meanness,
and intolerance of wrong. Everything that
belongs to a sound, solid, practical worth,—a
pure, and even a fastidious, virtue,—a virtue
beyond doubt or suspicion,—may be supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
attach to the man who is said, by emphasis,
to have “clean hands.” “<em>Not to swear deceitfully</em>,”—whatever
may be its precise shade of
meaning in the psalm,—may fairly be interpreted,
in a discussion like this, as standing
for honest and sincere speech, and as the type
of the virtuous use of the tongue. It excludes
from the idea of the character, deceit and
falsehood, concealment and equivocation, with
everything approaching to the <em>designed</em> conveyance
of a wrong impression by word or look.
In buying and selling, in barter or bargain, in
converse or correspondence,—in respect to whatever
business he transacts, and in relation to
every medium for thought—there is supposed
to be, in the man before us, scrupulous propriety
of language,—the utmost transparency of
meaning and purpose. He is simple, straightforward,
without the shadow of deceit or guile.
Then, “<em>a pure heart</em>,” in addition to habitual
“cleanness of hands,” and the maintenance of
entire integrity of tongue, is intended to express,
the co-existence of an upright <em>inward</em>
life, with the outward appearances of practical
goodness. It would not only imply, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the harmony of a man’s thoughts with his
words,—and the correctness of the motives of
his visible acts,—it would include in it, in its
scriptural import, the government of the passions,—the
control of the imagination,—sincerity
and depth of religious feeling;—every
thing not only chaste but devout, the whole
soul liberated from gross and corrupting affections,—free
from the drag and degradation of
the flesh,—and fairly detached from the adhesions
of earth, in all senses in which they would
imply bondage to the sensual or the secular.
“<em>Not to lift up the soul unto vanity</em>,” is intended
to express the freedom of the man from
idol-worship. The “vanities” of the heathen
were the idols or deities whom the heathen
adored; to whom they “lifted up their souls,”—or,
in other words, to whom they rendered
religious reverence, and before whom they appeared
in worship. “Cleanness of hands,”
then, “sincerity of speech,” “purity of heart,”
with all that they include, in their seminal
comprehensiveness, of outward and inward practical
virtue, are thus connected with regard to
<em>the true God</em>. The man has not only both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
morality and religion, but his religion is of the
right kind. It is as proper as to its object,
as it is sincere in itself. The man neither
worships idols <em>as</em> Gods,—nor idols <em>with</em> God,—nor
God <em>through</em> idols. “He has not lifted
up his soul unto vanity.” He has not been
seduced by the sun in his splendour, nor by
the moon in her brightness; he has not “kissed
his hand,” nor “offered sacrifices,” to “the
queen of heaven:” he has not “bowed his knee
to the image of Baal,” nor “fallen down to
the stock of a tree.” The language descriptive
of his feeling and practice would be that of
David in relation to himself,—“Unto <span class="smcapuc">THEE</span>, O
Lord, do <em>I lift up my soul</em>.”</p>

<p>It is easy to see, how this demand of character
in his worshippers adds to the proof of the
personality of God. Worship of any kind, to
have any meaning, implies personality;—but the
demand for worshippers of a certain sort, implies,
along with this, the possession, by Him whom
they are to approach and please, of personal
properties the same in kind with those of the
worshippers. Where there is virtue, there must
be thought;—where there are moral attributes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
there must be personal intelligence; and where
there is the necessity for these, as a pre-requisite
for worship,—the Being worshipped must
be supposed to be distinguished by moral attributes
as well as by intelligence, as thus, only,
could he properly appreciate, or consistently
demand, them. A God may be imagined to be
<em>better</em> than his worshippers,—he cannot rationally
be supposed to be worse. To have a perception
of goodness, and a sympathy with the
good, and to permit none but the latter to
stand before him, or to come into his presence,
God must not only be a person, but one whose
<em>own</em> character, must <em>itself</em> be pre-eminently distinguished
by goodness. It may be worth
observing, that moral ideas associated with worship,
operate in more ways than one. They
take a direction both upwards and downwards,
each action illustrating the other. The
character regarded with complacency in the
worshippers, indicates that of the God they
worship;—the character associated with the
God they worship, moulds and fashions that
of the worshippers. The deities of a people
will naturally influence their moral notions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
their moral behaviour. The object of worship
becomes the standard of virtue;—men will
imitate what they are taught to adore. If
there be <em>no</em> God, there need be no worship;—if
worship is rendered to unintelligent force,
it can be of no consequence, so far as <em>it</em> is
concerned, what the moral character of the
worshippers is;—if the God be conceived of as
sensual or malignant, lascivious or bloody, his
image may be expected to be mirrored in his
worshippers;—but if in all that approach him,
he peremptorily demands “clean hands” and
“a pure heart,”—with all that these include
of universal virtue,—he must of necessity be
considered to be holy Himself, while the habitual
worship of such a being must be regarded
as conducive to holiness in his servants. These
latter ideas are precisely those which the Biblical
idea of Deity illustrates. He is always
described, in the loftiest terms, as invested with
every attribute of excellence; as infinitely
removed from evil; as looking on the good
with delight; as permitting such only to approach
him; as bidding the bad far from his
presence; as detecting and denouncing hypocrisy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and formality; and as exposing the uselessness
of ritual acts and external observances
taken by themselves, and insisting on an inward
and earnest sympathy with his own love of the
holy and the pure.</p>

<p>In consistency with the course which more
than once we have already followed, we shall
here introduce a series of passages from the Holy
Scriptures illustrative of the statements which
have just been made.</p>

<p>“The holy one of Israel.” “He is the Rock,
his work is perfect;—a God of truth, and without
iniquity; just and right is he.” “The Lord
is in his holy temple;”—“worship him in the
beauty of holiness.” “For the righteous Lord
loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold
the upright.” “Unto the wicked God
saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes,
or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
mouth?—Thou thoughtest that I was altogether
such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee
and set them (thy doings) in order before thine
eyes.” “Thou art not a God that hast pleasure
in wickedness; neither shall evil dwell with thee.”
“Confounded be all they that serve graven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
images, that boast themselves of idols. For thou
Lord art high above all the earth; thou art
exalted far above all gods. Ye that love the
Lord, hate evil. Rejoice in the Lord ye righteous,
and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.”
“This people draweth nigh unto me
with their mouth,—but their heart is far from
me;” “Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, seek
ye me, and ye shall live;—seek good and not
evil, that ye may live.” “Hate the evil and
love the good, and establish judgment in the
gate that ye may live.” “To what purpose is the
multitude of your sacrifices unto me?” “When
ye come to appear before me, who hath required
this at your hand, to tread my courts? Bring no
more vain oblations; incense is an abomination
unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling
of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is
iniquity, even the solemn meeting.” “When ye
spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I
will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of
your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do
evil; learn to do well.” “Judge me, O Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
for I have walked in mine integrity. Examine
me, prove me, try my reins and my heart. I
have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go
in with dissemblers. I have hated the congregation
of evil doers; and will not sit with the
wicked. I will wash mine hands in innocency, and
so will I compass thine altar, O Lord.” “Lord,
who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall
dwell in thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly,
and worketh righteousness, and speaketh
the truth in his heart. He that backbiteth not
with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour,
nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
In whose eyes a vile person is contemned, but he
honoureth them that fear the Lord. He that
sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not. He
that putteth not out his money to usury, nor
taketh reward against the innocent. He that
doeth these things shall never be moved.”</p>

<h3 id="II_III">III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Christ.</i></span></h3>

<p>These representations lead to the consideration
of a third and last thing, which is essential to
the complete illustration of the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness
thereof.</span>” There is a God; God is to be
worshipped; none but the good can acceptably
worship him. So far all is plain. But men are
not good. Throughout the race there is a consciousness
to the contrary. In spite of the
operation of many amiable instincts, and in spite
of a large amount of passable virtue, it is quite
understood that there is a terrible mass of iniquity
in the world;—that there are the grossnesses
of brutal lust, and the refinements of a
fastidious licentiousness;—that there are falsehood,
and fraud, and lying, and theft,—all the
modes of open or secret dishonesty by which
men attempt, or contrive, to overreach each other;—that
there is the stupid animalism of rural
ignorance, and the arts, and appliances, and
accomplishments of crime, that abound in the
recesses of great cities;—it is well known that
corruption and depravity, in all these forms,
have made terrible havoc in all lands; and, what
is still more to the purpose, that among the
classes the freest from crime, there is so much
moral defect, and so many things having the
character of sin,—so much, especially, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
want of religious faith, and of indifference to
God, if not of conscious and positive enmity
against him,—so much, in fact, of what constitutes
the <em>opposite</em> of all that must be meant by
the term “holiness,” and of what is demanded
in those who can calmly “ascend into the hill of
the Lord,” and acceptably “stand in his holy
place;” that it would almost seem, on the admission
of the statements and principles advanced,
as if the worship of God must be given up as
hopeless, in a world like this, from the utter
impossibility of finding a sufficient number to
make up for him an assembly of fitting worshippers.</p>

<p>There is a difference between worship considered
as <em>the habitual service of the good</em>,—the appearing
before God of those of “clean hands” and
“pure hearts,” who are living in moral sympathy
with him,—and <em>the approach to his footstool</em>,
in shame and tears, <em>of the guilty and the
penitent</em>. It is the worship and character of <em>the
former class</em> that are contemplated in the description
of the psalm before us; which description,
with the demand involved in it, to be fully
and theologically understood, must be looked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in connexion with the entire service of the
Hebrew Institute, and the whole teaching of the
sacred volume. If a holy God can only be
approached by holy worshippers,—and that, too,
in a world of which holiness is <em>not</em> the natural
and characteristic attribute,—it is very obvious,
that he must either remain without ever being
worshipped at all, or some mode must exist by
which the inhabitants of such a world may <em>be
made</em> holy. Now this is just the thing which
the Jewish dispensation illustrated by a figure,
and which the Christian redemption is given to
the world to <em>realize</em> in fact.</p>

<p>The Jewish dispensation approached men, in
the first instance, as sinful and polluted, and
it established a system adapted to their necessities.
It set up its altar,—prescribed its
sacrifices,—appointed its institutions,—consecrated
its priesthood;—had its days of atonement,
and its ark of propitiation,—its paschal
lamb, and its burnt offering, and its scape-goat,
and its sprinkling of blood;—with everything
else that could either significantly presuppose
sin, or point to the necessity and the mode
of its removal. The Hebrew worshipper, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
appearing before God, was first required to come
into contact with the sacrifice and the priest;—he
confessed offence, acknowledged his just
exposure to punishment, brought his propitiation,
and <em>then</em>, being purified from his ceremonial
transgressions and the consequent disqualifications
he had contracted, by this appointed method
of approach to God, he was regarded as in a
state of fitness for his worship, and could thus
draw nigh as an accepted worshipper.</p>

<p>Now, there was a moral meaning in this
ritual arrangement. It was intended to teach
that, as ceremonial impurity needed to be removed
in order to acceptable outward service,—so,
spiritual guilt needed to be removed in order
to acceptable <em>spiritual</em> worship. When the
psalm before us, therefore, or any other, expatiates
on the virtues and excellences of the
man who is permitted “to ascend into the hill
of the Lord,” or allowed “to stand in his
holy place,” it is always implied, that he has
come to the attainment of the character described,
by a process of pardon and of purification
through the previous exercise of the
Divine mercy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>But, it is to be remarked, that the Levitical
Institute, while so fully set forth and impressively
taught the two great truths of the sinfulness of
man, and the necessity for some Divinely appointed
mode both for his reconciliation with God
and the renewal or sanctification of his nature,
did not reveal, completely and explicitly, what
that mode was, or what it was to be. It dimly
foreshadowed it;—it indicated the principle on
which it would proceed, and the parts of which
it would consist;—but it did this by type and
symbol,—anticipating, in a picture, the substance
and reality that were one day to be revealed.
It was very evident, from the Hebrew Institute,
considered as a Divine and intelligible appointment,
that men were to learn from it that their
approach to God was to be marked by solemn
and affecting peculiarities. They were distinctly
taught that they needed to be redeemed, reconciled,
pardoned, purified, in order that they might
be able to rejoice at the remembrance of God’s
holiness, or to appear before him as acceptable
worshippers; and they were further taught, that
in order to this,—that is, to their attainment
of pardon and its attendant advantages,—it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
incumbent that atonement should be made by
sacrifice, and that the priest should pass into the
Divine presence with the blood of the victim, to
bring thence, and through it, the blessings
needed by sinful humanity.</p>

<p>St. Paul tells us, in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
that the Levitical Institute taught this, and that
it was <em>intended</em> to teach it; that is, that it taught
what it was that humanity <em>needed</em>. But he tells
us more than that; he tells us that it <em>also</em> taught
that this thing that was so needed, and so wished
for, <em>was not yet revealed</em>, that it was not provided
by the Institute itself, in its own altar,
victim, or priesthood,—and would not be manifested
<em>so long as itself stood</em>; or, at least, that
the coming of it, as it would be the fulfilment of
what the Institute foreshadowed or foretold, would
be the signal and means of its dissolution and
departure. By the fact of sacrifice, and the
sprinkling of blood, and the washings and purifications
of their own ceremonial, the apostle says
it was evidently taught, that there existed a
necessity for the removal of sin and the cleansing
of the conscience; but then, by the <em>repetition</em>
of the sacrifices, the annual return of the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of atonement, and the mysterious darkness of
the holy of holies,—excluded from sight by the
awful veil, and permitted to be approached only
once a year, and that only by one individual,—by
all this, he says, it was <em>equally</em> taught, that
Judaism did not accomplish for man, <em>what it
informed him needed to be done</em>. The first
covenant had ordinances of divine service,—a
sanctuary—a veil—the tabernacle which is the
holiest of all. Now, into this, the high priest
alone went, “once every year, not without blood,
which he offered for himself and for the errors of
the people. <span class="smcap">The Holy Ghost this signifying</span>,
that the way into the holiest of all was not made
manifest, while the first tabernacle was yet
standing: which was a figure for the time then
present, in which were offered both gifts and
sacrifices, that could not make him that did
the service perfect <em>as pertaining to the conscience</em>:
which stood only in meats and drinks,
and divers washings, and carnal ordinances,
imposed on them <em>until the time of reformation</em>.”</p>

<p>Now, this typical and temporary character
sustained by the Jewish Institute,—this parabolic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and preparatory office which it had to
fulfil,—this suggesting merely, or setting forth
in a figure, of the wants of humanity and of the
<em>principle</em> which must pervade, underlie, and distinguish
the provision that must meet them,—this
prophetic announcement that priest and
sacrifice were yet <em>future</em>, but were certain to
come,—all this, while it shows the importance
of attending to the connexion between the Old
and the New Testaments, and of mutually interpreting
each by the other, gives, of necessity,
to the more spiritual portions of the Hebrew
records a far-stretching and comprehensive meaning,
which can only be understood by looking
at it in the light of the Christian revelation.
“<em>Coming events</em> cast their shadows <em>before</em>.” The
whole of the fabric and furniture of the tabernacle
were constructed and arranged upon this
principle. This principle was recognised and
embodied in the utterances of the prophets;—it
often pervaded the entire texture, or appeared
in parts, of one or other of <em>the psalms and songs
of the ancient church</em>. In looking at the intention
and significancy of Judaism, we should
imagine ourselves gazing on the floor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
temple and the front of the veil,—observing
them covered with flickering shadows falling
from objects which are unseen. There they
lie,—the distinct outlines of thing and person,—the
<em>shadows</em> of substances which are existing
somewhere, but which only, as yet, give notice
that they are, by this insubstantial intimation
of themselves. In the holy of holies, there is
the mysterious light of the glory of God seated
between the cherubims;—between that and the
hanging veil and the sacred floor, <em>some one
must be standing</em>, whom, as yet, we see not,—for
his shadow can be discerned on the veil
itself, and even on the floor, as we mark minutely
the appearances before us of light and shade.
<em>Some one is preparing to appear</em>, and to be
revealed, and manifested, in whose hands will
be found the substance of those other objects
whose shadows seem to be lying around us!—The
approaching events are thus prophetically
announced by these dim outlines; and, while
they are being so, voices are heard from the
great congregation, uttering <em>an equally prophetic
song</em>,—celebrating the glories of what
they <em>see</em>, but doing it in language which only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
finds its intended significance when applied to
and associated with what they see <em>not</em>.</p>

<p>On this principle it is, then, that we have prophetic
psalms;—psalms that are termed Messianic,
from their referring to the Messiah, and
anticipating his appearance, his sufferings and
death, his resurrection and ascension, his kingdom
and glory. Some of these refer, in their
primary application, to other individuals and to
mundane events;—they express the feelings and
anticipations of the writers in relation to themselves,
and they describe matters of immediate
concern or recent occurrence; but they do this
in language that admits of a deeper meaning and
a larger range;—the import of which they that
employed it might not know, and which <em>we</em> only
learn from the New Testament expositors of the
Hebrew text. When Jesus “opened the understandings
of the apostles, that they might understand
the Scriptures;” and when he condescended
to show them the true meaning of their ancient
books, he expounded to them, it is said, “What
was written in the law, in the prophets, and in
<span class="smcap">the Psalms</span> concerning <em>himself</em>.” The evangelists
and the apostles, in their future writings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for the instruction and use of the Christian
church, used this knowledge, or similar knowledge
from the same source; and thus it is, that we
find quotations from so many of the psalms,—some
in the Gospels, some in the Acts, others in
the Epistles of Peter and Paul. From one psalm
the apostle takes the expression of man being
made “a little lower than the angels,” to express
the fact of Christ’s coming in the flesh, with the
objects and results of it;—that “<em>he</em> was made a
little lower than the angels <em>for the suffering of
death</em>, that he might taste death for every man.”
From another psalm, he applies language still
stronger, to the same purpose. “Sacrifice and
offering thou wouldest not, <em>but a body hast thou
prepared me</em>: lo! I come to do thy will, O God.”
The apostle’s comment upon this is very remarkable.
Having quoted the passage, he proceeds
to reason upon it after this manner:—When he
says, “Sacrifice and offering, which are offered
by the law, thou wouldest not, neither hadst
pleasure therein, and then says, ‘Lo! I come
to do thy will;’ he takes away the first that he
may establish the second.” That is, he removes
and puts aside <em>the mere symbols</em> of the preparatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
dispensation, which were inefficient and
typical, and reveals <em>the reality</em>, which they were
meant to announce, and which they prophetically
foreshadowed. <em>That reality</em> was the Divine
“will” in its ultimate object, namely, “The
offering of the body of Christ” “once for all,”
“through the eternal Spirit,” “without spot;”
<em>by the which offering</em>, we are saved and sanctified;—for
it can do that <em>for the heart and conscience</em>
which the others only showed to be necessary by
what they did “<em>for the purifying of the flesh</em>.”
From another psalm may be collected the
physical circumstances of the crucifixion,—the
“cruel mockings,” the “piercing of the hands
and the feet,” the “parting of the garments
and casting lots;” together with the anticipated
mysterious utterances of the great sufferer, in his
“bloody sweat,” and his mighty anguish! In
another psalm, we find the resurrection;—the
soul of Messiah is “not left in Hades,” the place
of the dead, nor does “his body” in the grave,
“see corruption;” and in other psalms, we find
the foreshadowing of <em>subsequent</em> events:—his
ascension into heaven; his official position, and
mediatorial glories and functions, there; with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
much that relates to the corresponding effect
of all this on earth:—“Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee”:—“The Lord said unto
my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I make
thine enemies thy footstool.” “The Lord hath
sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest
for ever, after the order of Melchisedek.” “The
kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers
take counsel together, against the Lord, and
against his anointed:—Yet have I set my
king upon my holy hill of Zion.” “<span class="smcap">Thou
hast ascended on high</span>, <em>thou hast led
captivity captive</em>: thou hast received gifts for
men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the
Lord God might dwell among them.” Now,
this latter passage is to be particularly observed.
It is a passage taken from one of the psalms,—a
psalm sung at the removal of the ark, like
the twenty-fourth, and which, like it, is taken up
in the celebration of battle and war, victory and
conquest. It is to be noticed, then, that the
passage just quoted, is applied by the apostle
Paul, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, <em>to the ascension
of Christ</em>, and is connected by him with the
work which he came from heaven to accomplish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and the blessings which he returned to heaven
to dispense. “Unto every one of us is given
grace according to the measure of the gift of
Christ. Wherefore he saith, <em>When he ascended up
on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts
unto men</em>. (Now that he ascended, what is it but
that he descended first into the lower parts of
the earth? He that descended, is the same also
as he that ascended up far above all heavens, that
he might fill all things). And he gave some,
apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists;
and some, pastors and teachers; for the
perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
till we all come, in the unity of the faith, and of
the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a
perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of
the fulness of Christ.”</p>

<p>These last remarks will have revealed the
drift of this long discussion, and will enable
us now rapidly to bring it to a close. By
“reasoning out of the Scriptures,” we have
shown how the Levitical dispensation was, in
its rites and usages, preparatory and prophetic
of something to come;—by distinct passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
from the Book of Psalms, as quoted and explained
in the New Testament, we have shown
how the hymns of the ancient church anticipated,
by their recondite and profounder
meaning, the same things that were foreshadowed
in the ritual;—and, in the concluding
remarks on this point, we have shown,
how the apostle illustrates <em>the ascension of
Messiah, after successful battle and war</em>—returning
from conquest and crowned with victory—<em>by
referring to the words of a Hebrew Psalm</em>.
In the same way, then, we think ourselves
entitled to connect the 24th Psalm with the
mission of the Messiah, and to consider that
the close of it, if not an intended prophecy
of his ascension, is yet capable of being regarded
<em>as illustrative of it</em>; and that it should
suggest therefore the propriety of adding to
whatever truths of a general nature the first
verses of the psalm may embody, the specific
peculiarities of the Christian revelation,—that
revelation to which all previous discoveries were
preparatory, and without which they cannot be
complete. There is an emphatic sense, in which
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> is “the King of glory;” in which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
is to be regarded as having being engaged in
mortal combat,—contending with the enemy of
God and man,—overcoming him in a way as
mysterious as it was successful—by yielding
himself to be “bruised for our iniquities,” and
“stricken for our sins;” and that, “after
having by himself purged our sins,”—after
having, in the nature he had assumed, “presented
himself an offering and a sacrifice,” that
we might obtain “eternal redemption through
his blood,”—he rose again from the dead, proclaiming
his triumph over sin and Satan, by
showing that it was “not possible for him to
be holden” of Death; and further, that “he
ascended up on high,”—entered into heaven,
whose “everlasting gates” opened to receive
him, as one who was “leading captivity captive,”
and who came to ask and “to receive
gifts for men.” All this we are warranted in
connecting with the ideas which have already
passed before us, of the supremacy of God, the
duty of worship and the character of his worshippers,
and of finding in it the evangelical
element in which such ideas need to be baptized.
God is; God is to be worshipped; God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
is holy; <em>they</em> must be holy who habitually
approach him;—but “all have sinned and come
short of the glory of God:” “every mouth
must be stopped, for the whole world is guilty
before Him.” “<span class="smcap">Who</span>, then, shall ascend into
the hill of the Lord, or who shall stand in
his holy place?”—They, certainly, who have
“clean hands” and “a pure heart,” but—who
have <em>first</em> “made a covenant with God <em>by
sacrifice</em>;”—who have accepted <em>Him</em>, whom he
hath “set forth as a propitiation,” and “whose
blood cleanseth from all sin;”—who, as sinners,
draw nigh in <em>his</em> name, who is “the Way, the
Truth, and the Life,” and without whom “no
man cometh unto the Father;”—they who, believing
in Him “who died, rose again, and
continues to live,” and “who hath ascended
up on high that he might fill all things,” have
“received out of his fulness even grace for
grace”;—have obtained the pardon of actual
sin, and have received the gift of the sanctifying
Spirit which the Redeemer is emphatically
exalted to bestow;—they who, by the subjective
operation of the truth, are “washed, and justified,
and sanctified, in the name of the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Jesus and by the spirit of our God;” and who
know, by experience, that “the grace of God
which bringeth salvation, teaching them, that,
denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, they
should live soberly, righteously, and godly in
the world.” “<em>This</em> is the generation of them
that seek him, that seek thy face O God of
Jacob.” “These receive the blessing from the
Lord, and righteousness from the God of their
salvation.” “They that do these things, shall
never be moved.”</p>

<p>In this way, then, by taking the first verse of
the psalm before us, which constitutes the inscription
on the Royal Exchange, and looking at
it in connexion with the whole composition of
which it is a part, and by looking at that, also,
in connexion with the religious institution it
belonged to, and the entire revelation of both
Testaments, as gradually developing the great
system of mercy and mediation,—in this way,
we are taught to associate with <em>the general truths
of an elementary Theism</em>,—which is all that at
first appear to be proclaimed,—<em>the specific truths
of an Evangelical Christianity</em>. “The earth is
the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof;”—this simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
declaration of the primary principle of all
religion, when placed in the light emanating
from the whole constellation of discoveries which
surround it in the Jewish and Christian Scriptures,
is seen to involve in it, not only the existence,
the government, and the worship, of a personal
God, but the reality and the functions, the
work and the presidency, of a personal Redeemer.
They that “ascend into the hill of the Lord,
and that stand with acceptance in his holy
place,” must <em>be</em> holy because God is holy; but
it were terrible to make this demand upon humanity,
which is altogether deformed and dislocated,
and that manifests everywhere, when it thinks
of God, that its next thought is that God is
<em>against</em> it,—it were terrible, we say, to make this
demand, <em>if there came not along with it, the
proclamation of the offer, and the announcement
of the Divine method, of forgiveness</em>,—the “reconciliation”
effected by him who triumphed over
sin by the death of the cross, and who ascended
up on high in the might of his achievement, to
be at once the medium of our access to God, and
the Divine Distributor of the blessings of his
salvation. Men, as men—that is, as sinners—are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to believe the gospel, and to accept of Christ,
that, by faith and repentance, spiritually “entering
into the holiest of all, through the way he has
consecrated for them by his blood,” they may be
constituted the church; and then, <em>being</em> the
church,—that is, sinful men justified and sanctified
<em>through him</em>,—they are “to bring forth the
fruits of the spirit” in their lives, and habitually
to worship “in the beauty of holiness.” The
virtue that we demand in the worshippers of
God, under the rule of the Christian dispensation,
is the virtue that flows from religious faith;
that faith being, the exercise of trust in the
redemption of the gospel. To have “clean
hands” and “a pure heart,”—to be sincere and
upright in lip and life—we exact of <em>all men</em> as
their daily duty; but in order to possess these
in a proper manner, so that they shall be vital,
Christian holiness, and not a superficial and
secular virtue, there is a <em>previous</em> duty which
behoves to be attended to,—the submission of
the mind to the faith of Christ,—penitent approach
to an offended God through the one
divinely-appointed Mediator, “in whom we have
redemption, through his blood, the forgiveness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of sins according to the riches of his grace.”
Being “made partakers of the Divine nature,”
through the influence of the quickening and
sanctifying Spirit, they will then not only have
“their fruit unto holiness,” and cultivate, from
the force of a necessary law, and as impelled by
a regal and irrepressible instinct, “<em>whatsoever
things are just, and whatsoever things are pure,
and whatsoever things are true, and whatsoever
things are lovely and of good report</em>,” but they
will be a part of “the priesthood of God,” endowed
and consecrated by an unction from himself,
that, in the various acts and exercises of
the Church, they may constantly offer up “spiritual
sacrifices acceptable to him by Jesus Christ.”
These engagements, again, will re-act on their
personal character, and have a constant tendency
to advance and elevate it, and help their attainment
of a practical perfection. In this way,
men, <em>first</em> “having obtained like precious faith”
with the Apostles, “in the righteousness of God,
and of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ;” will
be divinely taught the secret of a real and accumulative
excellence. “Having escaped from the
corruption that is in the world through lust,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
they will “give all diligence to add to their faith
virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge
temperance, and to temperance patience,
and to patience godliness, and to godliness
brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness
charity.”</p>

<p>An intelligent adherent of the Scriptural, Protestant,
and Evangelical faith of the living
Christianity of this realm of England, associates
all we have endeavoured to illustrate in the whole
of our discussion with the simple inscription on
the Royal Exchange. It is a text from the Bible.
It recognises the Divine authority of the book;
and the recognition of that authority in one of
its sayings, carries with it the admission of the
whole of its utterances. “The earth is the
Lord’s and the fulness thereof.” The association
of this, in a devout mind, is easy and natural
with the exaltation and glory of the Redeemer
of the world, whose last words when he left it
were, “All power is given unto me in heaven
and in earth,” and who, upon this, based the
command which he gave to the Apostles, “Go
ye, therefore, into all the world, and preach the
Gospel to every creature.” The government of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the earth is in the hands of Christ; it is mediatorial;
it is not only that of goodness and beneficence,
but it is that also of revealed mercy.
God “will have all men to be saved, and to come
unto the knowledge of the truth,” for his son
“gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in
due time.” There is <em>another</em> “fulness,” besides
that of the teeming earth, and the annual redundance
and prodigality of nature. There is
“<em>The fulness of Christ,—the fulness of him who
filleth all in all</em>;” the complete development of
“his body the Church;” and the full-orbed
display of his perfections and glory, when “to
him every knee shall bow of things in heaven
and things in earth; and every tongue shall confess
that <em>he</em> is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father.” All this, the thoughtful observer associates
with the sentence that daily meets the eyes
of the citizens of this great metropolis. All this
is being ceaselessly uttered in the hearing of the
assembled congress of nations;—it is held up in
the sight of the many and multitudinous representatives
of the various tribes and peoples of the
earth! <em>What would be the future of Europe
and the world</em>,—moral, political, social, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
religious,—<em>if England and its visitors alike learnt,
and fully carried out, all that is involved in what
the one is proclaiming in the ears of the others</em>?</p>

<p>In the succeeding pages of this book, we shall
endeavour to reply to this question.</p>

<h3 id="THE_ARGUMENT_RECAPITULATED">THE ARGUMENT RECAPITULATED—THE RELIGIOUS
ANTICIPATION OF THE FUTURE ILLUSTRATED
AND JUSTIFIED BY THE HOPES OF
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILANTHROPY.</h3>

<p>We began this book by referring to the circumstance,
that the same illustrious individual
who originated the idea of “the Great Exhibition,”
and who has done so much to extend
and realize it, suggested as an inscription for
the Royal Exchange, a single sentence from our
English Bible—“<em>The earth is the Lord’s and
the fulness thereof.</em>” It is the first verse of the
24th Psalm. The suggestion was adopted;—and
hence, on the front of the building referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to,—in very plain letters,—rather rude if any
thing,—without adornment,—or figure or flourish
of any sort—but conspicuous and legible, in our
own homely, honest, Saxon tongue, stands, open
to all the world, the public proclamation of our
faith as a people—“The earth is the Lord’s
and the fulness thereof.” It stands there, on
the front of the edifice, which is the commercial
centre of this great city,—the place of
meeting for the men of different lands and of
many languages, who, as the representatives of
every clime and country upon earth, constitute,
daily, a sort of typical gathering of all
nations,—men connected with the “<em>industry</em>,”
by being connected with the trade and traffic,
of the world.</p>

<p>We proposed to put the two things together,—the
inscription on the Exchange, with the
anticipated gathering in the Palace of Industry,—and
to consider the first as announcing
to the second certain great truths, and these
again as involving universal duties; and we
further proposed to consider, in conclusion,
what would be the result, to Europe and the
world, if, by ourselves and our many visitors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
with the aggregate of nationalities whom they
will represent, these truths were all to be
acknowledged, and the duties resulting from
them were all to be done.</p>

<p>We then proceeded—taking in connexion
with the first verse of the psalm, which constitutes
the inscription on the Exchange, the
entire sacred composition of which it is a
part,—and viewing <em>that</em>, too, in connexion with
the whole volume of Divine Revelation to
which it belongs—we proceeded, on this principle,
to develope and illustrate the truths and
the duties to which we referred. Thus expounded,
we found the confession, that “the
earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof,”
to include the following things. It involved,
in the first place, <em>the existence of God</em>;—the
acknowledgment of this,—and the acknowledgment
of it in connexion with the idea of
<em>personality</em>. In the second place, it involved
God’s proprietorship of the world and man,
and the recognition of this as carrying with it
the acknowledgment of his being <em>the Creator</em>,
since, immediately after the statement that “the
earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the Psalm goes on to say, “the world, and
<em>they that dwell therein;—for he hath founded
it upon the seas and established it upon the
floods</em>.” In the third place, we educed from
the confession that the “<em>fulness</em>” of the earth
is God’s, the doctrine of <em>Providence</em>, including
in that, the original disposition of materials
for the service of man in the construction of
the globe,—the whole arrangement of things,
animate and inanimate, on its surface,—the
establishment of all the laws of production,—the
continual <em>administration</em> of these laws, by
God’s personal supremacy and presidency over
nature,—the gifts which he confers, on nations
and individuals, of contrivance and skill, taste
and genius,—with whatever else belongs to the
constant communication of good, and the progressive
advance and improvement of society.
All these ideas were largely illustrated by various
striking passages of Scripture; and the acknowledgment
of the truths of <em>Creation</em> and <em>Providence</em>,
were both shown to involve in them further
evidence of the previous truth of the Divine
personality.</p>

<p>We next advanced to some additional ideas of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
both truth and duty, which the acknowledgment
of all this involved,—especially as this acknowledgment
was illustrated by the whole psalm
that was supposed to be before us, and as <em>that</em>
was illustrated by the whole scheme of Divine
discovery developed in the Bible, and the connexion
between the Jewish and Christian revelations.
We found the following things to be thus
brought out. In the first place, the duty of
<em>worship</em>:—this was suggested by the question,
which immediately follows the acknowledgment
of God, of creation, providence, and the Divine
proprietorship of the earth and the world,—“Who
shall ascend into the hill of the Lord, who
shall stand in his holy place?” Next, there
was the answer to this question, which involved
the obligation of <em>universal virtue</em> in God’s worshippers—that
is, upon all men, since <em>all</em> men
are alike bound to worship him: “He that hath
clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not
lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.”
This was expounded as a demand for
inward and outward purity—purity of soul, lip,
and life—in all who habitually approached God
in the solemnities of worship. But this demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
for universal virtue in <em>each</em> worshipper,—associated
with the obligation of <em>all</em> men to worship,—viewed
in connexion with the general consciousness
of defect and sin, and the proof and
prevalence of ungodliness in the world,—led, in
the third place, to the discussion of the great
question—<em>how humanity was to come to the attainment
of that character, which was essential to
the fulfilment of its religious obligations</em>? To be
in a proper moral and spiritual state for the discharge
of habitual, acceptable worship, considered
as a duty, we found, by a process of
scriptural reasoning, to involve <em>another</em> and <em>a
previous</em> duty; that, namely, <em>of accepting the
gospel as a system of mercy, and of submitting
to Christ as the Redeemer of the world</em>. We
argued this, from looking at the lessons taught
by the principle that pervaded the appointments
of the Jewish ritual, and the prophetic bearing
on the promised Messiah, of some of the hymns
used by the people in the Hebrew worship. We
showed how the whole of the ancient Institute
taught the necessity of atonement and sacrifice,—pardon
through a propitiation, and purity and
holiness as divine effects; we saw how it intimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that it did not <em>itself</em> provide these, but, by
typical rites, significant ceremonies, and prophetic
songs, anticipated their coming in “the fulness
of time,” when they should be procured
and dispensed by one who was regarded as the
hope and “the desire of all nations.” Without
positively saying that the latter part of the
twenty-fourth psalm was a distinct and <em>intended</em>
prophecy of Christ, we showed, from the language
of those psalms that are so, as quoted and
expounded in the New Testament, that it might
consistently be regarded as <em>illustrative</em> of Christ—of
his return in triumph to the heavenly world,
when, after having “overcome the sharpness of
death,” “he ascended up on high, to receive
gifts for men, even for the rebellious, that the
Lord God might dwell among them,” and that
<em>they</em> might become the holy and spiritual “priesthood”
of God. In this way, we endeavoured
to show how an intelligent Christian might associate
with the first verse of the twenty-fourth
psalm, all the scriptural revelations respecting
<span class="smcap">Him</span>, who, in the <cite>Te Deum</cite>,—one of the noblest
of ancient Christian hymns,—is invoked in language
borrowed from the close of it: “<em>Thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
art</em> <span class="smcap">the King of Glory</span>, <em>O Christ!</em>” and that
thus, the simple words on our Exchange, which
at first sight appear to announce only the general
principles of Theism, would come to utter in
the ear of instructed reason and enlarged faith,
the specific truths of an Evangelical Christianity.
It thus comes to pass, that we are taught ourselves,
by the inscription referred to, and shall
teach the nations to whom we exhibit it, that,
for men “to ascend into the hill of the Lord,
and habitually to worship in his holy place;”
appearing there in “the beauty of holiness,” and
everywhere exemplifying universal virtue; they
must <em>first</em> come to him as sinners, through
Christ, and that, then, being cleansed from their
sins, by being “washed, justified, and sanctified,
in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of
our God,” they can constitute a holy, <em>worshipping</em>
Church; and with “clean hands,” and “pure
hearts,” offer up “spiritual sacrifices,” fragrant
and acceptable to Him whom they approach,—such
approach, again, ever re-acting on their
further attainment of personal righteousness.</p>

<p>It now only remains for us to conclude and
complete our originally projected course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
observation, by setting forth what would be the
future condition of the nations, <em>supposing that
all the world learned and practised the truths and
duties which have thus been enumerated</em>.</p>

<p>It is not unnatural to look at the subject in
this way. Philosophers, and politicians, and
social economists, are all regarding the great
event which is just at hand,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as constituting the
beginning of a new era and of better times;
and as embodying in itself something like a
prophecy of a brightened and improved future
for the nations. For the first time in the history
of the world, there is to be a flowing of the
peoples of all lands to one spot. They are not
summoned together by blast of trumpet; they
come not inflamed by mutual animosities, nor
with souls bent on conquest and carnage. Nor
do they come for the purpose of witnessing
games and tourneys,—feats of strength or
speed,—the rude contests of muscular athletæ,—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
skill of charioteers,—the sanguinary spectacle
of gladiatorial shows,—or the combat of plumed
knights, with their glittering armour and gallant
bearing, their caparisoned steeds and gay attendants,
making war look like a holiday entertainment.
The gathering of the nations about to
be held is to be altogether of another sort. The
crowds that move to it, are not to move as a
thunderbolt or a whirlwind, carrying in their
course havock and desolation; they are to bring
with them, in their tranquil march, the useful
products of their respective countries, and the
bloodless trophies of their industry and their
skill. These are to be all collected and arranged
in one great and extraordinary edifice, where they
are to enter into a sort of peaceful contest and
amicable rivalry, while the people themselves of
every region are to mingle together, and to look
on, and to observe, and compare, and wonder,
and rejoice:—and it is expected to come to
pass, that however unable the most of them
may be to understand the spoken languages of
the rest, all will be able to read and to interpret
what will be written everywhere on the whole
scene, and to comprehend the import of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
common voice that shall seem to be issuing from
the objects around them. The products of the
different regions of the earth will recognise each
other as belonging to one and the same world;
the multitudes of things that will illustrate the
achievements of skill and industry, though constructed
or fabricated by the hands of men of
many languages, will have among themselves a
common dialect—a language of their own—but
which all the different national workers shall
alike understand. Everything will speak of
oneness, brotherhood,—the same nature, the same
faculties, the same Father,—the folly and wickedness
of men <em>not</em> “living together in unity,”—of
their degrading powers that are so wonderful,
and so prolific of wonders, and desolating a
world which they have such vast ability to beautify
and adorn! From such a lesson it is
hoped and expected that the crowds will disperse
wiser and better,—more loving and more fraternal;
and that a basis will be laid for such
future peaceful and profitable intercourse, as shall
render war an utter impossibility. It may be
supposed, also, that the approaching event will
only prove the first of a long series of similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
exhibitions, which shall successively occur in all
coming time, and which shall take place in
different cities of Europe and America, till at
length they may be fixed in some distant region
of those lands that witnessed the birth or were
honoured by being the cradle of the race, or in
those which are at present the nurseries of
nations as yet without a name. The whole
thing, to some minds, is thus shaping itself into
a prophetic type of a new aspect of the civilized
world. But it is easy to see, that this prophecy
is one which includes many others; for it could
not be fulfilled, to the extent of its grand and
comprehensive meaning, without a variety and
number of important social and political changes
being supposed as the necessary conditions of
such a spectacle in <em>other</em> lands, as that which
is possible and prepared for in our own.</p>

<p>We are merely adding then, to the calculations
of philosophy, the higher thoughts suggested
by the principles of our national faith,
when we take the truths included in that
faith, and, supposing them to be received by
the nations of the earth, as we have drawn
them out from the words that are enthroned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
in the midst of our city and in the sight of
all men, proceed to inquire what would be
the result of their being universally learned and
embraced, and the duties they impose being
universally obeyed. The inscription on the
Exchange, if appropriate for <em>it</em>, is appropriate
for the Palace of Industry too.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is a glorious
thing to think that we are living at such
a time as this, and are about to witness such
a festival as that projected by the Consort of
our Sovereign;—not the banquet of a vain
and idolatrous voluptuary, making “a feast for a
thousand of his lords,” ready to desecrate what
is sacred to religion, and to pour out libations
of wine and strong drink, that “he and
his princes, his wives, and his concubines, may
lift up themselves against the God of heaven,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
blaspheming his name and abusing his gifts,
and “praising the gods of gold and of silver,
of brass and of iron, of wood and of stone;”—it
is not this, or we might expect the appearance
of a mysterious hand, once more, with
its “<span class="smcapuc">MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN</span>,” to pronounce
the doom of a voluptuous court and
a devoted country;—it is not this, but a vast
banquet for the eye and the intellect, the heart
and the reason;—and one, too, projected on
such a principle of recognising in all things
the dominion of Him “who liveth for ever
and ever,”—and “who ruleth alike over the
hosts of heaven and the inhabitants of the
earth,”—“in whose hand our breath is, and
whose are all our ways,”—and “<em>from whom
cometh</em> the gold and the silver, the brass, the
iron, the wood and the stone;” the fruits of
the earth and the abundance of the seas;—with
every power and faculty of man—ability
to accomplish and capacity to enjoy;—the
whole thing so proceeds, we trust, on the
acknowledgment of Him,—that, instead of a
vision to strike terror and to scatter in confusion,
we should rather imagine that we see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
written,—in radiant letters, by the hand of
love and not of vengeance, to kindle devotion
and strengthen faith,—on the crystal walls of
the Palace of Industry, giving a glory to all
its contents—“<span class="smcapuc">THE EARTH IS THE LORD’S, AND
THE FULNESS THEREOF;—THE WORLD, AND THEY
THAT DWELL THEREIN.</span>”</p>

<p>Supposing this, then, to become the creed
of the world, enlarged and illustrated by Christian
associations, and for all its personal and
practical lessons to be fully carried out, let us
see what would be the condition of human
society.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> These pages were written previous to the opening of

taken, however, from the Prayer-book translation of the
Psalms, instead of from that of the authorized version. The
sense is the same, although the phraseology is slightly varied.

</div>

</div>

<h3 id="III_I">I.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Universal Theism.</i></span></h3>

<p>In the first place, there would be, everywhere,—in
all lands and in all hearts,—the belief and
acknowledgment of the one living and true God.
All doubt, denial, and error, respecting this
cardinal and central truth, would have passed
away. There would be no Atheism,—the
rejection and repudiation of a personal God;
no Pantheism,—which is only Atheism under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
another name; no Scepticism,—professed uncertainty
as to whether there is really a God
or not; and no Polytheism—the belief of a mere
rabble of divinities. All these forms of thought
would cease and determine, and give place to the
universal admission of the great fact of the Divine
existence. No human being would be to be
found, who could look over the earth with all its
wonders, and survey the heaven with its sun
and stars,—and see no proof or probability in
either, of the existence anywhere of a being or
a personality <em>greater</em> than himself! This is the
amount of the Atheistic creed,—if creed it can
be called, that consists only in denials and negations.
The universe is <em>a thing</em>,—wonderful indeed,
but nothing more,—having no consciousness,
no capacity for voluntary action, nothing about
it of personal properties; and, if there be no
independent personal God, then, the greatest
being that is known to exist in the whole universe,—the
only one that can be spoken of as
a person, is man himself!—a somewhat lame
and impotent conclusion!—a poor summit to
the infinitude of things! There are those who
say that they believe this;—there will be none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to say it, when it comes to be a universally
admitted truth, that “the earth is the Lord’s,
and the fulness thereof.” In the same way,
there will be no thinkers, or professed thinkers,
whose minds, repelled by the gross darkness
of positive denial, but not drawn into the light
of positive belief, wander in the fogs and mists
of uncertainty, and “reason downwards till they
<em>doubt</em> of God.” And in the same way, the
myriads of gods, which the Asiatic nations
conceive to be filling the heavens and the
earth,—large and small,—great and little, but
most of them debased,—will all disappear, like
the more elegant system of the Greeks, that
once divided the domain of nature, and parcelled
it out among its subordinate divinities. Cleared
and cleansed from all these various forms of
error, the large heart of universal humanity
will be open to the air and the sunlight of
true thought, and will reflect, as from a mirror,
the image of Him, who has “set his glory
above the heavens,” and of whom it is said,
that “the knowledge of him” is abroad
“in all the earth,” since, “from the creation
of the world,” he hath made manifest, “by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the works of his hands,” “even his eternal
power and Godhead.”</p>

<h3 id="III_II">II.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Universality of Christian Worship.</i></span></h3>

<p>In the second place, there will be added to
this universal acknowledgment of God, as the
object of belief, a further recognition of him
as the object of worship. All men would be
worshippers of God, if, throughout the world,
there should be not only the prevalence of the
belief of that God is, but the working out of
the results of that belief,—that <em>because</em> he
is, he is “the hearer of prayer,” and that
“to him,” therefore, “all flesh should come.”
Taking this subject, however, in connexion with
all the explanatory illustrations which we have
already advanced, it is easy to see that it is
of wide compass, and will include far more than
might at first be apparent.</p>

<p>The God, whom we suppose to be acknowledged,
is the God of the Bible, and the worship
by which we suppose him to be approached,
would be worship conducted on the principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
which pervades it, and regulated by all that
its spirit and precepts concur to prescribe.
The Being referred to in the Scriptural expression,—“The
earth is the <em>Lord’s</em>,”—is not
one whose existence and character are demonstrated
by philosophy, and who may thus be
considered as a sort of hypothesis;—it is, as
we have said, <em>the God of the Bible</em>,—the God
who has made himself known by supernatural
facts and verbal revelation, and whose discovery
of himself in the works of his power, and in
the constant displays of his wisdom and beneficence,
is to be supplemented and enlarged by
the whole of the utterances of his grace and
mercy. On this principle it was, that we took
the expression, “The earth is the Lord’s, and
the fulness thereof;” not as an independent and
isolated sentence,—not as a thing to be looked
at by itself,—but in connexion with the contents
of the entire volume of which it is a part: and
we saw, when we did so, that it brought out,
into great prominence, such a view of the
teaching of Scripture in respect to the relations
of God and man, as necessarily affected,
very materially, the whole theory and practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of worship. But it is this <em>view</em> of the meaning
of the passage, that we are supposing to be
learned and acknowledged by the nations, and
therefore the worship, in which we are further
supposing them to unite, would of course be
<em>that</em> which the whole of our exposition would
inculcate or explain.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, too, that philosophical Deism
never leads to worship in its disciples,—at least
not to anything in the form of regular social or
public acts. It is possible for a simple Theist
consistently to pray, or to extol and adore the
Deity he acknowledges; and it <em>may</em> be, that
some Theists privately do so,—though all probabilities,—it
may by no means <em>uncandidly</em>, be
said,—are rather against it. What would be
possible and consistent, however, in a Deist by
himself, would be equally so in a company of
such. On the principle of their believing in a
personal God, they might meet together for
public worship. <em>But they never do.</em> The mere
admission of the one principle that God is, would
seem not to be sufficient to lead men to worship;—it
needs to be connected with another principle—that
which affirms that “God <em>has spoken</em>,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
or that, by some means, he has supernaturally
made himself known, revealed his interest in
human nature, and drawn near,—or <em>draws</em> near,—to
the human race. All religions, always and
everywhere, have pre-supposed something of
supernatural intercourse between God and man;—they
have had, or have, their traditionary
belief of divine appearances,—their notions of
a priesthood peculiarly favoured or filled by
the divinity, through which, and through whose
acts, the people could acceptably approach and
pray. The believers in the Bible believe, of
course, in supernatural manifestations of the
Divine Being, made to them in the records,
and embodied in many of the facts, of
the book; and it is this belief that makes
them worshippers. For the habit of worship,
then, facts everywhere and abundantly
demonstrate, you must have a religion; and
for the existence of religion, you must have
the belief of supernatural discoveries of God
to man, in addition to the display of himself
in his works. Deism is not a religion, but
a philosophy; it has a God, but it does
not worship; and it does not worship, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
God, according to its conception of him, has
never broken the silence of nature, or narrowed
the distance between him and his creatures by
passing over the limits of fixed law. All men
who worship, whether their worship be pure or
corrupt, do so, we repeat, because they have a
religion, and they have a religion, because they
believe in something supernatural as to their
knowledge of God; something which makes
their belief of him <em>faith</em> in what is demonstrated
by miraculous fact or divine statement;
and not merely <em>opinion</em>, as the logical conclusion
of a speculative philosophy.</p>

<p>These principles and reasonings being apprehended,
will clear the way to the intelligent
perception of the variety of things that must
be understood as included in the idea of all
the world becoming worshippers of God, <em>as the
result of their perception of what we, as a
nation, are supposed to teach</em>. For men to be
worshippers, their knowledge of God must be
religious, not philosophic; for it to be religious,
it must be founded on belief in a supernatural
revelation; it will <em>be</em> this, when they acknowledge
that “the earth is the Lord’s, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
fulness thereof,” in words taken from the Jewish
Scriptures, and regarded as an utterance of, the
Divine voice. By such an acknowledgment they
will recognise the <em>whole</em> of those Scriptures,
as “given by inspiration of God,” or, as
written by men who wrote “as they were moved
by the Holy Ghost.” But the admission of <em>this</em>,
will draw with it the admission of the <em>second</em>
series of writings, and the acknowledgment of
their intimate connexion with the first, as the
perfect development of what the first foreshadowed,
and the record of the fulfilment of
what they foretold. The faith of the men, therefore,
who begin with the confession that “the
earth is the Lord’s,” and who profess it in the
words of a Divine saying, and <em>as such</em>, must go
on till it takes in what the Hebrew institute
taught in type, and the Hebrew prophets uttered
in words, when they “spake beforehand of the
sufferings of Christ, and of the glory that should
follow;” and it must still go on, and can only
be rationally and consistently complete, when it
receives the whole of the evangelical discoveries
of the New Testament respecting the redemption
of the Christ of God. <em>This</em>, then, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
be the faith of future society, the world over;
and by <em>this faith</em> its worship would be regulated,
if, as we are supposing, the nations should learn
from us our religious belief in all its extent, and
should follow it out in all its obligations.</p>

<p>The worship of the world, then, would be
Christian worship. Men would be worshippers,
because they would be religious; they would
be religious, because they would have a religion,
not a philosophy; and that religion, would be
the one taught in the Christian Scriptures, and
founded on the facts of the Christian revelation.
All that we shall say of the consequence of this,
at present, is, that, just as the admission of a
personal God puts aside all forms of denial or
error upon that point, so, the admission of a
particular form of Divine discovery, and the
establishment of worship according to the principles
of a specific revelation, will put aside all
other systems of worship, and overturn the
pretensions of all other supernatural beliefs.
Mohammedanism and idolatry would alike die
under the predominance of the Christian sentiment;—the
one as including too little, in not
adding to the knowledge of God the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of the redemptive act of the Christ; and the
other as including too much, in having “gods
many and lords many,” and worshipping these
through visible objects, or regarding the visible
objects as Divine; thus “falling down to the
work of their hands,” and “turning the truth of
God into a lie.” When Christian worship shall
be universal in the earth, the gods, and priests,
and altars and temples of all other religions
will have departed; everything gross, cruel, and
obscene will have passed away, and have given
place to the practical knowledge of the one living
and true God,—to Him, “who is of purer
eyes than to behold iniquity,” and who requires
to be worshipped by men of “clean hands”
and of “pure hearts.” Then will be brought to
pass many of the sayings that are written in
<span class="smcap">the Book</span> which often portrays, in prophetic
song, visions of the triumph of religion and
righteousness, and of that <span class="smcapuc">FUTURE</span>, which it
sees, and celebrates, and it is <em>to make</em> for humanity.
“The Lord will famish all the gods of
the earth.” “The idols he will utterly abolish.”
“It shall come to pass, that the gods which
have not made the heavens and the earth, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
they shall perish from the earth, and from underneath
these heavens.” “So men shall fear the
name of the Lord from the west, and his glory
from the rising of the sun.” “For, from the
rising of the sun even to the going down of the
same, his name shall be great among the Gentiles;
and, in every place incense shall be offered
unto him, and a pure offering.” “Behold the
days come, saith the Lord, when they shall not
teach every man his neighbour, and every man
his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for all
shall know me from the least even unto the
greatest.” “In that day, shall there be one Lord
and his name one.” For “the kingdoms of the
world shall become the kingdoms of our Lord,
and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever
and ever.”</p>

<h3 id="III_III">III.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>The Scriptures will purify and restore the Church.</i></span></h3>

<p>But in the third place, as we are supposing
the nations of the world to be intelligently led
from the simple sentence,—“the earth is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Lord’s, and the fulness thereof,” to the admission
of the contents of the entire book, and the full
understanding of the whole system of mercy
and mediation, as developed in shadow, in
the Hebrew ritual, and given, in substance, in
the work of Christ; and as we are supposing,
that, because of the fact of their knowledge,
their worship will be Christian;—we wish it
further to be observed, that, because of the
<em>mode</em> of their acquiring that knowledge, and
on account of <em>the accuracy</em> and <em>extent</em> of it,
their worship will not only be Christian as to
its <em>general</em> character, but it will come to be of
a kind distinguished by certain <em>specific</em> peculiarities.</p>

<p>That is to say, learning their faith from a
certain book, and from being taught to comprehend
the entire contents of it,—and finding
in that book, that though there are “some
things in it hard to be understood,” it is yet
in its entireness <em>the property of the people</em>; it
will come to pass, that all the people will claim
to possess it,—will stand to their claim,—and
will enforce and carry it, until there shall be
none that shall dare to deny or to resist. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
again, a whole world of intelligent and earnest
men, with the Bible in their hands, as Divine
thought,—studying the book “till the word of
Christ dwells in them richly, in all wisdom and
spiritual understanding,”—“having the form of
knowledge and of truth” there;—marking and
comprehending “the things that differ,” and
spiritually taught to distinguish between that,
which, however glorious when in its proper place,
came, at last, to have “no glory, because of the
glory that excelleth;”—“waxed old and vanished
away as a thing that was done with,” in consequence
of that coming in its stead, which was
never to be moved—never to be surpassed, and
never supplanted by any further or superior dispensation;—men,
understanding all this, and
understanding, too, that, in consequence of it all,
they have the knowledge of a sacrifice which
could never be repeated,—and “a great High
Priest of their profession, who has entered into
heaven, and appears in the presence of God for
them,”—and that themselves are “a holy priesthood,”
and that spiritual acts, affections, and
duties, <em>are the incense and sacrifices of the
Christian church</em>, “with which ‘<em>alone</em>’ God is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
pleased;”—such men—and we are supposing the
whole world to be such—would cleanse Christendom
of the corruptions of the faith, just as
Christianity, generally considered, would, by
its active and universal diffusion, subvert and
extinguish the idolatries of Heathenism.—Human
priesthood, visible altars, the sacrifice of the
mass, literal incense, the “lifting-up of the
soul unto vanity,” in the sense of the adoration
of saints and martyrs, the worship of a woman,
of pictures, images, and relics of the dead,—ecclesiastical
tyrannies, popular superstitions, and
popular serfdom,—with everything else that is
incompatible with a vital and diffused Christian
intelligence,—all these would pass away;—the
one offering of the one Priest—and the exclusive
intercession of the “one Mediator between God
and men,”—would be the only things before the
mind of the churches;—while they would meet
habitually, and meet everywhere, to worship in
simplicity,—“in spirit and in truth,”—undeceived
by empty ritualisms,—regaled and refreshed
by “a rational service,” and edified and
established by a ministry of instruction. Christ
will be understood to be “a priest upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
throne;” to be the Head of the church, and the
superior and “Prince of the kings of the earth,”
and to hold in his hands “the keys of death and
of the invisible world,”—“to open so that no man
can shut, and to shut that no man can open;”—and
when all this is apprehended by the nations,
<em>it will not be endured</em> that there shall be a sort of
blasphemous mimicry of it all in the pretensions
and claims of the Man of Sin. “The earth
is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the
world, and they that dwell therein;”—when this
is understood, in its Christian acceptation, and
all men are aware that for all equally “Christ
died,”—that they are his property, and that
none are to interfere between him and his,—that
<em>He</em> alone is “Lord” alike, “of the dead and of
the living,” and that by “setting his love” on all,
he makes each individual spiritually “great,” and
stamps a dignity on the nature he redeemed,—when
these things are known and felt, there
will be none who will “lord it over God’s
heritage,” or none to submit to the attempted
usurpation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="III_IV">IV.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Universal Virtue.</i></span></h3>

<p>In the next place,—in consistency with the principles
previously expounded, of the character that
God demands in his worshippers,—the necessity
to their acceptance, in divine service, of their possession
and culture of universal virtue,—and the
manner by which, in Christian worshippers, virtue
expands and developes into holiness;—in
consistency with this, we have next to remark,
that when men have become what we have
sketched <em>as to religion</em>, there will be the prevalence
among them of <em>an elevated morality</em>.
It is not denied that there may be virtue and
morals without faith;—and that the honourable,
and the true, and the lovely, and the beautiful,
in habit and behaviour, may exist in the
man who is destitute of religion. It is quite
possible that an individual who denies that “the
earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof,” by
denying that there is any Lord to whom it can
belong;—who, therefore, has no sense of religious
reverence,—no idea of Divine authority,—no
thought of a future account,—who never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
worships, never acts from spiritual motives, or as
“seeing Him who is invisible,”—it is quite possible
for such a man to find reasons in the present,
visible constitution of things, for making the
best of the life that now is, by living purely,
uprightly, and honestly in the world. We admit
this. But we are now supposing that all men
have risen into a higher sphere, through the
reception and power of religious faith,—and that
their virtue, instead of being a thing that has
its roots in the earth, and is nourished by mere
mundane influences, is a thing which flows down
upon them from heaven, and is quickened and
invigorated by intercourse with God. The <em>religious</em>
man, if he be true to his privileges and
profession, will have all the virtues of the man of
the world, besides some others which the latter
has not;—and still further, as those that they
have in common, are, in <em>him</em>, fed and sustained
from a far higher and diviner source than what
nourishes those of the man of the world, they
ought to be seen to be both more pure and more
elevated than his, in simple correspondence with
that circumstance. Future society, then, being
supposed to have come under the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
religious truth,—to be reconciled to God through
the death of his son, and to be regenerated and
renewed by the sanctifying Spirit, and, as such,
habitually “to ascend into the hill of the Lord,”
and to worship acceptably “in his holy place,”
it is to be expected, as the result of this, that
it will “increase and abound in all holy conversation
and godliness.” Now, there is no personal
or social virtue that the New Testament
does not inculcate, or that the spirit of the
gospel is not adapted to nourish and expand.
If the nations of the world were each to possess
a national religion in the sense of <em>the whole
nation being religious</em>, then, every individual
would be chaste and temperate, upright and
truthful, fortified by the strength and softened
and adorned by the beauties of holiness. Every
family would be loving and harmonious; parents
wise and worthy of respect; children obedient;
brethren living “together in unity.” All business
would be conducted justly; commercial transactions
would be all clean, and capable of being
touched with “clean hands;” trade and handicrafts
would be noble and dignified, by being
pervaded by the great idea of “duty,” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
attended to on principles which would be the
very same as those that control the doings of
an angel, or direct and inspire a seraph in his
songs! Nowhere would be seen drunkenness,
or seduction;—robbery and murder would be
things of the past. There would be no oppression
on the part of the rich; no pride or tyranny
in the powerful; no injustice between class and
class; no envy in the less favoured of God’s
children, prompting them to harsh or petulant
judgments of their more distinguished or opulent
brothers. There never can be literal and absolute
equality of station or circumstance;—there
never can be a uniformity of rank or possessions.
In the most perfect condition of the world and
man, there must still of necessity be master and
servant, the employer and the employed;—the
head of one, the hand of another, the capital of
a third, the back for a burden, and the feet for
toil; all these will always be required, and must
be furnished, and must act, in any improved
state of society. But they may act harmoniously.
There need be no fraud, oppression, or
injustice. There may be everywhere given “the
fair day’s wages for the fair day’s work;”—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
there may be everywhere rendered “the fair
day’s work for the fair day’s wages.” Society,
like the church, is a body with its members.
It has its head and feet, its ear and eye, its
mouth and hands;—the health of the body, or
its physical perfection, does not consist in every
member having the same office; but in all fulfilling
their respective functions, without disturbance,—each
being thus in unity with the
rest. The perfect and healthful development
of society consists in a condition analogous
to this. Christian communism, and Christian
socialism, if anything of the sort shall hereafter
be, will be found to consist, not in
society’s ceasing to be a body by becoming
entirely but one member—a huge head, or a
gigantic foot, or a great, swinging, muscular
arm,—but in all the members acting healthily
in their own place; and, while doing so, each
having the same care of the other. In this
way, and in this way alone, can society be preserved
from opposite dangers;—from becoming
a monster without parts, that must of necessity
perish from the want of organic or functional
vitality—or being torn by intestine schisms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
dissensions that must tear it to pieces or make
it explode!</p>

<p>It is not possible to enlarge on these and
kindred matters, that might be introduced under
the present illustration. Enough has been said
to make manifest the general principle, that, on
the supposition of the diffusion in the world
of an intelligent, vital, and uncorrupted Christianity,
there would result from it the fruits of
a universal righteousness. Every family would
be “a church in the house;” children would
be trained in the way they should go; and
conversion from outward, practical wickedness,
would be seldom needed in adult age. Education
would be universal. Learning and knowledge
would be “the stability of these times”—with
the fear of God, and the hope of salvation.
Science would be devout, and literature pure.
The universe would be explored with reverence
and humility; discoveries announced without
boasting; and improvements and inventions received
with gratitude. No books would be
written to demoralize and corrupt,—nor the
arts be allowed to minister to licentiousness.
Industry would be cheerful, and labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
honoured; the fruits of the earth would be
taken and used as a Divine gift; and the
productions of skill would be connected with
thoughts of the Maker of the mind. In that
day, there would be on every object “holiness
to the Lord,” for all men would act in consistency
with the belief, that “the earth is His,
and the fulness thereof.”</p>

<h3 id="III_V">V.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Nationalities.</i></span></h3>

<p>In the last place: it only remains to be
remarked, that this universality of religion and
righteousness, in each nation of the earth respectively,
would come to have an effect on the
relations and intercourse of each with the rest,
and on its own internal constitution and action.
If all nations were really to believe that “the
earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof,” and
especially to connect with this the next clause,—“the
world, <em>and they that dwell therein</em>;”—and if
they were honestly to carry such a creed fairly out,
into all its great practical results,—it would be
found to be the charter of peace and freedom, order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and liberty, in all lands. Let men get the idea
that the earth is God’s, not theirs,—and that all
the race are alike his,—his, at once, as created by
his goodness and redeemed by his mercy;—and
especially let it be imagined, that all habitually
mingled in his worship, and that all felt inspired
by a desire to live in constant, practical harmony
with his will;—why, there could be neither war,
nor slavery, nor anarchy, nor despotisms;—men
<em>could</em> not be brought, on the supposition suggested,
to be trained and taught to <em>slaughter</em> one
another!—or to <em>steal</em> one another!—or to buy,
and sell, and fetter, and lash those who were the
exclusive property of God, and who, whatever
their colour, were each of them as much <em>a man</em>
as themselves! No monarch could be seduced
into the belief that a whole people was made for
<em>him</em>;—or that power was not <em>a trust</em>;—or that it
could be used for any purpose but the good of
the nation, and according to the eternal principles
of right on which God himself governs his
own. Nor would a people imagine that any new
institutions would benefit them, or any change
or revolution be an improvement, if they were
not each of them a king over himself.—We do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
mean to say that one form of political government
may not be intrinsically better than another;—but
we do mean to say that the Future of
the world will no more be distinguished by the
same form of political government being universal,
than by the universal prevalence of one
mode of ecclesiastical polity;—and we further
mean to say, that the diffusion of an intelligent
and instructed Christianity would carry into the
bosoms of all men the Scriptural principles, that
government is the institution of God;—that God,
in this respect, is the God of order;—and that
reverence for authority and submission to law are
as much Christian duties as anything else.—Authority
may be abused, and law may be
unjust; but he who acts in the fear of God, will
suffer much, and think more, before he will be
persuaded that political rebellion and disobedience
are virtues. We do not say that there are not
occasions when the one may be patriotic and the
other right;—but there is a time coming when
none in the places of trust and power will so act
as for this to be the case,—and when none in
those of submission and obedience will feel that a
dignified and manly loyalty has become either an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
impossibility or a burden. Governors, nowhere,
will fear discussion; or fetter the press; or
refuse reforms; or cripple independence;—and
people, nowhere, will abuse their rights; or
desire, or demand, the unreasonable or unjust.
The aggregate of families, which make up a
nation, living in unity, like each of the families
that constitute or compose it, the aggregate of
nations will dwell together in the same spirit,
and with the same results. Commerce will
bring, more and more, the whole earth into
friendly intercourse;—the sea that would seem
to divide the nations, shall be as a chain to bind
people to people, and land to land. Instead of
meeting for hostile purposes, there will be the
interchange of visits to promote science, to perfect
literature, to spread art, to cultivate religion—or
to honour God in the results of industry, by
the circulation round the world of an Exhibition
like that which is just at hand. If, in all these
ways to which we have adverted, the lessons of our
Royal Exchange were to be learned, and we ourselves,
and our expected visitors, to carry them
out, in the full development of individual, social,
and national life,—many of the pictures of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
prophets would be realized; the kingdom of
heaven would be established on the earth; and
the tabernacle of God would be universally with
man. Evils might remain, but everything would
tend to mitigate or diminish them. The world
would be a temple,—the nations a church;—all
work would be a daily worship, while daily worship,
strictly so called, would hallow and sanctify
all work. The day of rest would be welcomed
as it came,—but welcomed for its devotion, as
well as its repose. From all hearts, from all
hands, from palace and cottage—from the mine
and the market-place—from the field and the factory—the
forge and the loom—the city and the
sea, from all nations and from all men,—there
would be going up constantly to heaven, that
which is required when Christians are exhorted
in language like this—“Dearly beloved, I
beseech you, by the mercies of God, <em>that ye
present your bodies as living sacrifices</em>, holy and
acceptable to God, which is your reasonable
service.” Were this ever to be universally
realized, the final cause of the creation of the
world, might, without a figure, be said to be
attained. God’s great idea would be seen to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
complete; and He himself, if we might so
speak, after being grieved by the wickedness of
the race, would return again to the unruffled,
deep, and ineffable satisfaction with which he was
filled before the world was, when, anticipating the
results of his creative energy, “<em>he rejoiced in the
habitable parts of the earth</em>, <span class="smcapuc">AND HIS DELIGHTS
WERE WITH THE SONS OF MEN</span>.”</p>

<h3 id="PRACTICAL_SUGGESTIONS">PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS.</h3>

<p>Having thus filled up our originally projected
outline of thought, we shall rapidly conclude
and consummate the argument by two or three
practical suggestions.</p>

<p>1. In the first place, a few hints may not be
inappropriate as to the spirit with which Christians
should contemplate the Exhibition. There
are some prophets, of these our times, whose
“scrolls” in relation to the great event, are filled
with “lamentation, mourning, and woe.” They
can see nothing, in the thing itself, but a gigantic
display of pride and vain glory,—and they apprehend
nothing, from the meeting of the nations,
but mutual corruption, prolonged riot, and perhaps
blood. Their favourite analogies are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Tower of Babel, Nebuchadnezzar’s golden image,
or the Devil tempting Christ by revealing on the
mount “all the kingdoms of the world and the
glory of them,” or some such human or diabolical
atrocities! Now it is a pity to give way to these
dark imaginings;—to see nothing in our fellow-man
but what is bad, and to expect nothing from
the hand of God but the thunderbolt of vengeance,
or the “vials of wrath!” It is far better,
far more becoming, especially in those that
believe that “the earth is the Lord’s, and the
fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell
therein,” to take healthy, cheerful, and hopeful
views, of the great event,—whose origin, it is at
least possible, <em>may</em> have been good, and whose
influence and results <em>may</em> be useful. It ought by
no means to be thought a self-evident thing, that
there is nothing in the multitude of minds and
hearts, which have all been engaged in perfecting
the Exhibition, but selfish vanity and godless
pride. In many there may have been frequent
and great thoughts of God, devout humility, and
earnest prayer for that blessing without which
nothing can be successful. Supplications may
have gone up, in various languages and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
many lands, that God would direct and crown the
work, and cause it to promote his kingdom and
glory; and, though the numbers may have been
small, who have thus sought to hallow and sanctify
the project by prayer, in comparison with
those who are interested in it without devotion
and without reference to the Divine blessing,
<em>Christians</em> should remember, that, in a world like
ours, living under mercy, the very principle of
the Divine government is, to bless one man
through the medium of another, and even to
bless the many for the sake of the few;—just as
ten men of righteousness and of faith might have
saved the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and as
those that were saved, were saved on account of
one such man,—for “when the Lord destroyed
the cities of the plain, he <span class="smcap">remembered Abraham</span>,
and—<em>sent Lot out from the midst of the overthrow</em>.”
Let Christians, therefore, have faith in
one another. Let them believe that many as good
as themselves are engaged in the Exhibition, and
have devoutly sought for it the blessing of the
Most High. Let others learn to do likewise.
Instead of indulging in forebodings and prophecies
which, being uttered, might fulfil themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
they should rather exercise trust in Providence,
indulge hope for the church and the world, and
earnestly endeavour to serve both, by hearty,
honest, and sincere <em>intercession</em> for all nations, and
for all men,—that that God, who can make even
“the <em>wrath</em> of man to praise him,” would educe
praise and glory to Himself, and much that shall
be productive of happiness to men, from what
brings them together <em>in peaceful intercourse</em>, and
reminds them of their common relation to himself.
The “crisis” of the world occurred when there
was a gathering of strangers and foreigners in
one place;—they were brought together at the
time of the crucifixion,—they were assembled
again at the wonders of Pentecost,—and there
can be no doubt that there was a designed coincidence
on both occasions. God has sanctified
the meeting of numbers, of “men of every
nation under heaven,”—“Parthians and Medes,
and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia,
and in Judæa, and Cappadocia, in Pontus,
and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt,
and in the parts of Libya, about Cyrene, and
strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes,
and Arabians,”—God has sanctified a gathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
like this to his own purposes,—to the establishment
of his kingdom and the spread of his
truth; and what he has done before he may do
again; and he <em>will</em> do it, if Christians devoutly
and earnestly seek it, by such a spirit of prayer,
as, “loving all things, and believing all things,
and hoping all things,” will crave at his hand
a blessing for their brothers, and crave it so that
it cannot be denied.</p>

<p>2nd. In <em>visiting</em> the Exhibition, there are many
sentiments which Christians might indulge as
means of impression or improvement to themselves.
It is hardly necessary, after having gone
through the foregoing argument, to press upon
the reader the duty of seeing and remembering
God in all that will be displayed of the riches of
nature and the products of art. It is true, indeed,
that it is to be the Exhibition of the
Industry <em>of the Nations</em>,—that is, it is, in a
manner, to reveal and magnify <span class="smcapuc">MAN</span> by accumulating
and displaying his wonderful works. But
there is a way of doing this, that may be humble
and religious, and there is a way of regarding
and of looking upon it, which may minister
much to the health and nourishment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
divine life. To think highly of what man <em>is</em>,
and to strengthen such thoughts by becoming
familiar with what he has <em>done</em>, may only make
us think more wisely and wonderfully of God,
and more justly of <em>the worth of the soul</em>, and
of the importance of salvation to that nature
whose capacities would seem to be so mysterious
and so vast! To think of man lying like a
wreck on the outside of Eden, naked and ignorant,
without a teacher and without tools,—his
mind darkened, his spirit depressed,—with understanding,
indeed, and impulses and instincts
to help him in his first efforts at labour,—a
whole world of raw material under his foot, the
compass of the earth for the sphere of his
achievements, his head and hand the instruments
of action, but the one as yet without
knowledge, and the other equally without skill!
And then to think of what he has done! How
that poor, solitary, naked man, beginning with
some rude attempt at the cultivation of the earth
and the collection of flocks,—seeking for himself
and his dependent companion, the mere
supply of their animal wants, clothing of the
coarsest, unwoven and undressed,—with food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
unprepared and unpalatable,—and shelter that
might be furnished by a few trees or a hole in
a rock! To think what he has become <em>since
then</em>! How one generation has improved upon
another, and how discovery and invention, and
labour and skill, and industry and genius, have
covered the earth with a succession of wonders;
and <em>then</em> to think, how a sort of representative
epitome of these is to stand before us in the
marvellous contents of the last and greatest
wonder of the world! That wonder will include
specimen and proof of what man has done for
himself and his dwelling-place, since he lay
helpless on the margin of the earth, like a ship-wrecked
mariner that had got to shore, but with
the loss of all things. Guided and helped by
the Divine power, but in a manner consistent
with his intelligent nature, his free thought and
personal agency, the mind of man was developed
and enlarged, society formed, and arts and
handicrafts, science and letters, rose and realized
what history records, and what modern civilization
so wonderfully represents. Rock and forest,
earth and ocean, animated nature in all its
forms, everything placed around and beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
him, supplied materials which he learned to
employ for his convenience and use. He covered
the earth with towns and cities, erected temples,
palaces, and pyramids,—subdued the most stubborn
of the beasts of the field, tamed the most
ferocious, outstripped the swiftest, and reduced
the strongest to obedience and servitude. He
clothed himself in skins, in fur, in flax, in silk
and wool,—gradually improving as he went on,
till fineness of fabric and elegance of design
have become the property of the people at large.
He decorated and adorned his private abode,
and filled public buildings and public places
with the creations of beauty and the triumphs of
art. He has crossed the ocean and sounded its
depths; he has penetrated the earth and drawn
thence her concealed treasure; he has interrogated
nature, and obtained, or forced from her,
the most astonishing replies; he has soared
into the heavens, has counted, weighed, and
measured the stars; he can foretell events with
certainty and precision—the appearance of a
comet, or the occurrence of an eclipse; he has
made fire and water, lightning and steam, to do
his bidding,—to transmit his messages, transport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
his property, carry himself, lighten his
labour, and perform his work. He has given to
sound sentiment and eloquence, and has made
instruments of music that can subdue multitudes.
Of all these achievements, and of a
vast variety of other forms of skilfulness and
power, the Great Exhibition will present the
proofs, and exhibit them in their latest and
most perfect development. And yet it is to
be remarked, that with all it will do, <em>it will
leave the greatest and the most wonderful of
the works of man uncollected and unseen</em>.
Mechanical industry has its many marvels,—art
and science their miraculous results; but
the highest form of the greatness of humanity
is to be met with in books,—in the art that
has given visibility to speech, and permanent
endurance to thought and emotion,—and in
the thoughts and emotions of gifted minds,
which, in every age, and in all lands, have
adorned the race by the researches of the
intellect, the conflagrations of eloquence, and
the sublimities of song. These things cannot be
represented in the Palace of Industry; and yet
these are the things that belong to the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
regions of the mind;—to powers and faculties
that more than anything else illustrate the
inherent greatness of man;—that lead him to
the contemplation of the right, the divine, the
beautiful and the good in action and character;—that
render him capable of religious faith;—and
that might make him a happy and virtuous
intelligence if he were called to exist
separate from the body,—without the feeling of
physical necessities, without a surrounding material
world, and without members to mould
and fabricate, and work up anything whatever
in the way of mere mechanical dexterity.</p>

<p>Now these thoughts, and a thousand others
of a kindred sort, may all be indulged by a
reflective man in visiting the Exhibition,—indulged
devoutly, and turned to eminent spiritual
advantage. Every thing that man is
seen to have achieved,—every proof of his sagacity
and power, his skill and performance—will
only enhance, in a thoughtful soul, the impression
of the wonderfulness of that nature which
God originally made for himself, which sin has
degraded, and which Christ has redeemed.
The number of such proofs increasing the conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of the wonderfulness of the nature they
so marvellously manifest, will render the fact of
redemption credible,—increasing the probability
that God should interpose to recover and restore
it. And the great fact, that, after all that
the grand pageant can do, and in spite of the
splendour and magnificence of its contents, it
will actually leave the most wonderful portion
of the human mind unillustrated, and incapable
of illustration,—why, this may well lead to
the solemn remembrance of some of the most
impressive of Scriptural truths. “What is a
man profited, if he shall <em>gain the whole world</em>
and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give
in exchange for his soul?” “All flesh is as
grass, and <em>all the glory of man</em> as the flower
of grass; the grass withereth, the flower fadeth,
<em>but the word of the Lord endureth for ever</em>; and
this is the word which by the gospel is preached
unto you.” “<em>All these things shall be dissolved</em>;”
“<em>the earth and all things that are therein shall be
burned up</em>,—but we, according to his promise,
look for new heavens and a new earth in which
dwelleth righteousness.” And still further, the
fact of the exhibition of the <em>half</em>, merely, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the greatness of man by the works of his
hands, (and <em>that</em> the lesser and lower portion,)
may suggest the analogy that there is in this,
with the manner of God’s discovery of himself.
He, in his works, has revealed and illustrated
his wisdom and power, goodness and
beneficence, and, to the eye of reason, these
are largely reflected there;—but the manifestation
of his <em>moral</em> attributes, his justice and
love, compassion and mercy, is made to faith in
the gospel of his Son; and however most men
may be alive to the first, and blind or insensible to
the second of these discoveries, there are beings
in the universe who are intent on the higher
exhibitions of God,—just as there are devout and
meditative men who will gaze on the wonders
of the Palace of Industry only to be reminded
of the spiritual and immortal of human
nature, which the edifice with its marvels will
do little to illustrate! Heaven has its “fulness”
as well as earth. That fulness is “the
fulness of Christ;”—his sufferings on earth and
the glory that is to follow. This is called “the
unsearchable riches.” In the mystery of redemption
are “hid,” or lie embodied, “<em>all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
treasures</em> of wisdom and knowledge,”—<em>the higher
forms</em> of God’s manifestation of himself to his
creatures. “Into <span class="smcapuc">THESE THINGS</span> <em>the angels
desire to look</em>.” And they do this in exact
conformity with the Divine purpose in the revelation
of himself in this the greatest of his works,
for it was set forth, “<span class="smcapuc">TO THE INTENT</span> <em>that unto
the principalities and powers in heavenly places</em>,
might be made known <em>by the church</em> the manifold
wisdom of God.”</p>

<p>3rd. But British Christians have a great and
solemn lesson to learn from the view that we
have taken, in this discussion, of their language
to the world. If it be so, that we profess as
a nation, and utter openly in the hearing of
all men, <em>the truths</em> that have been illustrated,
then, also, ought it to be felt, that we lie under
the most binding and imperative obligations to
exemplify <em>the duties</em> which have been explained
and enforced. It becomes us to cultivate the
devout and practical recognition of God; to keep
his Sabbaths; to wait upon him in worship; to
approach him through Christ, that we may do
so acceptably; to “live in the spirit,” that
“we may not fulfil the lusts of the flesh;”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
“to walk in the spirit,” that our daily virtue
may be divine holiness. It is well “to hold
forth the word of truth,” and to witness for
God, for the gospel, and for righteousness, in
the sight of the nations; but it must be done
<em>practically</em> as well as by profession,—by conduct
in harmony with the articles of our creed,—or
our testimony will expose us to ridicule and
rebuke, and may provoke by its mockery the
vengeance of the Most High. Let England
beware, that it do not itself, amidst the blaze
and glory of the Great Exhibition, forget the
truth and the lessons taught by it, that “the
earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.”
Let it beware, “lest, being lifted up with pride,
it fall into the condemnation of the devil.” It
is a terrible thing not to give God the glory of
our achievements;—“to sacrifice to our own
net, and to burn incense to our own drag.”
It was when the king’s heart was lifted up
with pride, and when he said to himself, “Is
not this Great Babylon that I have built,”—it
was then that God smote him from on high,
seared his intellect, and sent him to herd with
unintelligent natures! England is first in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
commerce of the world; her “merchant princes”
are the nobles of civilization; her markets and
manufactures have decked her with beauty and
made her great;—but it would be well for her
to remember, that it was just such a country
that, in ancient times, had her magnificence
described with the greatest minuteness by God’s
prophets, but described to illustrate the extent
of her ingratitude, the aggravations of her sin,
and the certainty and completeness of her predicted
destruction. It was fearfully realized.
The glory of Tyre was swept away, and her place
became bare as the top of a rock, on which the
fisherman might spread out his net to the sun!
It might be well, too, to remember, that the
prophetic description in the book of the Apocalypse,
of the Babylon that is to fall in some
yet future judgment of God, is the description
of a commercial and maritime city, over which
the merchants of the earth mourn and lament
“because her judgment hath come, and no
man buyeth her merchandise any more.”
That these instances should neither be type
nor prophecy of Britain, she must take care
to walk by the light of her own creed—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
“the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness
thereof,”—and according to all the devotion
and humility and practical righteousness that
this would inculcate. It is well with a people
when their garners are full and their flocks
prolific;—when their sons are as plants grown
up in their youth, and their daughters as
polished marble columns; when there is no
political convulsion in the land, and no complaining
of poverty in their streets. “Happy
is the people that is in <em>such</em> a case;” but
<em>happier</em> they “<span class="smcap">whose God is the Lord</span>.”</p>

<p>4th. Trusting that, as a people, we are not
altogether inattentive to what has been described,
let us learn, in conclusion, the value we should
attach <em>to the blessing of our characteristic and
national Christianity</em>. We do not mean, the forms
or peculiarities of any church;—the secondary
distinctions, that may have their importance, as
the separate testimonies to a particular truth
prominently held by different members of the
Protestant family. We refer to our <span class="smcap">evangelical
Protestantism</span> <em>itself</em>, which is substantially the
same throughout our many sects, and which is
held and taught, with more or less clearness, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
all the influential Denominations in the land. To
this, under God, we owe our free political constitution,
our civil rights, and our religious liberty;
to this we are indebted for the power we are at
present exercising and using in the face of the
world,—the power of throwing our metropolis
open to the nations,—receiving them all, without
passports, and with hardly a precaution, to
our streets and squares, our court and senate,
our families and our homes. We have no
fear that our soldiers will be corrupted, or
our population seduced;—we apprehend nothing
of injury to our faith, or of temptation to our
loyalty. Our press will be as free, our minds as
unfettered, our comments on men and measures
as outspoken, as if none were our daily audience
but ourselves. To impress the moral of all this
on the mind of the reader, and on our own, we
might do it, perhaps, most effectively, by putting
it in the form of a friendly address to a reflective
foreigner, who might be looking with wonder on
the phenomena around him. “Stranger,” we
might say, “you have looked with surprise on
our industry and commerce, our trade and manufactures;
you have seen in our equipages the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
signs of our wealth; and, in other ways, how
opulence and comfort are diffused among our
people; you have been impressed with the many
proofs of our intelligence, and have wondered,
perhaps, most of all, at the liberty we enjoy and
the loyalty we cherish. You have seen <span class="smcapuc">A QUEEN</span>
<em>honoured and beloved</em>;—and her Royal Consort
taking the lead, not in reviews of military pomp,
or only in the parade of magnificent hospitalities;
but in presiding over the displays of peaceful
industry, and welcoming the representatives of
science and art. You have seen the multitudes
that crowd to our churches, and wondered at the
comparative quiet of our sabbaths. <em>Know</em>, therefore,
that for all this, and for far more that is
unseen, we are indebted <em>to the glorious inheritance
of our faith</em>;—our <span class="smcap">open Bible</span>, our conscientious
inquiry, our habits of worship, and
our religious instructors. We have much
amongst us of which it becomes us to think
with shame;—much of which it is impossible
to speak but in moderated phrase, and even
with tears;—but if there is anything that has
raised thy admiration, or inflamed thy curiosity,—anything
in our general reverence for law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
in our political moderation, our civil order,—our
respect for rank, combined with our individual
consciousness of personal manhood; if
there is anything that shows that our morals
are not debased, or our manners frivolous, or our
habits sordid, or our minds enslaved by the
gross and the voluptuous,—carry away with
thee the certainty and conviction, that everything
that may be good about us as a people, we owe
to our possession of <em>that</em> <span class="smcap">one Book</span>,—to our
mode of interpreting, and our constancy in
teaching it,—<em>which tells us to acknowledge</em>,—and,
by God’s blessing, helps us to act, however
imperfectly, on the practical belief,—<em>that despotism
and priestcraft, anarchy and disorder,
pride and oppression, vanity and selfishness,
lawlessness and wrong, are all alike disobedience
to God and injurious to his creatures</em>, <span class="smcap">for
‘the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness
thereof; the world, and they that dwell
therein</span>.’”</p>

<h2>Postscript.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE EXHIBITION OPENED.</span></h2>

<p>The first of May, eighteen hundred and fifty-one,
was a day to be remembered to all time!
On it the nations of the earth combined together
to “make history,” in a manner they had never
done before;—in one also, which, in its prominent
peculiarity, can never be repeated.
There may be similar Exhibitions in future
periods of the world’s progress, but <em>the first</em>
can never be again. Even respecting those
which may be imagined to occur, although
they may be distinguished by new features and
characteristics of their own, and though these
may, in some respects, surpass those of the one
now opened, they cannot be anticipated with
that depth of interest, nor excite by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
inauguration those profound emotions, which preceded
and distinguished the sublime event which
has just taken place. The preceding pages
were written in the prospect of that event,
and were intended to appear before its occurrence.
The author cannot regret, however, that
circumstances interfered with the fulfilment of
his purpose, since to this he is indebted for
the opportunity of adding a supplementary section
to his little work, commemorative of the
grand and magnificent ceremonial of which he
was privileged to be a spectator.</p>

<p>It is not the writer’s intention to attempt to
describe the opening of the Exhibition, with all
that minuteness of detail in respect to what
occurred in the interior of the structure,—or
with those stirring delineations of the bustle
and excitement, the lines of carriages and congregated
crowds, that imparted animation to
the scene without,—which have already been
furnished by the public prints. He merely
wishes to note a few things which were interesting
or suggestive to his own mind, and
especially such as were felt to be in harmony
with the spirit and object of the present volume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>It was his good fortune to obtain admittance
into the Palace of Industry, on the memorable
morning of the first of May, before the gates
were opened to the public. He had traversed
it frequently during the previous weeks, and
had seen it in various stages of its progress.
One morning, in March, he was there so early,
that while walking along its galleries he observed
that he was the <em>only visitor</em> upon them at that
moment. Few of the counters were then
erected, hardly any of the articles unpacked;—the
wide spaces and vast dimensions of the
wonderful structure spread before him in clear
and unobstructed perspective;—there was something,
too, of solitariness in his position, though
multitudes of workmen were occupied below,
above, and around him;—the whole scene, from
its simple magnitude, was inexpressibly sublime;
it stirred within him thoughts and feelings which
were not, indeed, “too deep for tears,” but
which could only find utterance and relief in
their indulgence; while, as he passed on, and
for the first time saw the compartments of the
different countries, and read the names of the
various nations that were preparing to stand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
side by side, in peaceful rivalry,—his emotions
deepened to an intensity which it was difficult
to bear, and which cannot be described! He
was in the building, also, for some time, three
days before the opening, and could then form
some idea of what would be the number and
variety of its contents; though so much, even
at that late period, remained to be done, that
he wondered how it would be possible for the
preparations to be finished by the time appointed.
As, however, he walked into the transept, when
that time had come,—approached the centre,—and
looked along the naves stretching to such
an extent on either side,—it was not without
a feeling of admiration and surprise, mingled with
something of solemnity and awe, that he looked
on the splendid and gorgeous spectacle that
stood revealed in all its completeness!</p>

<p>The mere material scene was sublime when
beheld by itself,—empty, and comparatively still;
but much more impressive and affecting was it,
when filled with its immense multitude of spectators.
There was much that was stirring in
the sight of the rush and inundation of the
crowd, as it kept flowing in, in vast waves, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
every opening; and much that was impressive
when the noise and murmur of its movements
had subsided,—when all had found or had
been forced into their places,—and when floor
and gallery, and every part that the eye could
reach, was seen to be occupied by human
beings,—by an assembly larger than any that
had ever, in England, been congregated before
under one roof,—and by one that had met for
an object, and under circumstances, unparalleled
in the annals of the world!</p>

<p>Men see in all external events and objects,
what the light that is in them reveals. Things
are, to us, what we are to them. He that visits
foreign countries, brings back according to what
he takes. The same sight may be a very different
thing to two different persons, in proportion
as they may differ in knowledge, in opinion,
in taste, in sympathies. The eye of a clown may
look on a prospect that in some souls would
produce rapture or occasion tears, with hardly
more intelligence than that of the ox that he
drives before him. The outside of things is
open to all; their inner significance is revealed
only to those who have an inner eye to read it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and even such significance may be differently
interpreted according as the eye is influenced
and affected by the degree of intelligence, the
tendencies, and the tastes of the inward man to
whom it belongs. It is quite possible that some
may see nothing in the great Exhibition but an
ordinary, though enormous, fancy bazaar; and
that others saw nothing in the ceremonial of
the opening but a state pageant, court dresses,
and an immense crowd of men and women! It
is quite possible, too, that some of the incidents
of the day, which appeared to us touching in
themselves, or pregnant with meaning, were
indebted for this to the capricious activity of our
own fancy, as well as to their inherent beauty
or significance. But, however this may have
been, there certainly were some things that we
felt to be deeply interesting as they occurred,
and remarkably suggestive as illustrating the
character and tendencies of the event. We
shall not attempt to recall all that struck us at
the time; but a few words may not be amiss
on what immediately bore, or appeared to us
to bear, on some of the topics of this book.</p>

<p>On getting a sight of the catalogue of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Exhibition,—which we did before entering the
interior of the building,—we were gratified to
find on the cover and the title-page:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">“The earth is the Lord’s, and all that therein is;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">The compass of the world, and they that dwell therein.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We were aware that this was to be the English
motto, and that two Latin ones had also been
selected. We were glad to find the Divine sentence
placed where it was, and placed by itself; that
it stood, as it were, in <em>front</em> of the Nations as
they joined one another, and moved towards the
great point of attraction; that it <em>faced</em> them,
and spoke as with the voice of an oracle; that
while the words of men occupied their proper
subordinate position <em>behind</em> those of the book
of God—out of sight—needing, as it were, to
be sought for, and found, and <em>solicited</em> to announce
themselves,—these stood in their solitary
majesty, revealing themselves by their own light,
claiming to speak as having a right to be heard,
and authoritatively announcing to the diversified
tribes and peoples of the earth, and to every
visitant of the palace of wonders, <em>Whose</em> they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
themselves were, and to whom belonged <em>all
they saw.</em></p>

<p>This volume was written and in the press
before we were aware that <em>the inscription on the
Exchange</em> was to be <em>the motto of the Exhibition</em>;
otherwise, the natural course would have been,
to have taken the words in their <em>latter</em> use rather
than the former, and thus to have expounded
and illustrated what England <em>actually does say</em>
to herself and the nations through the medium
of the event which is bringing them together.
When we first heard of what was to be the
English motto of the catalogue, we were exceedingly
disposed to wish it could be given
in the words of the authorized version (those on
the Exchange) “The earth is the Lord’s, <em>and
the fulness thereof</em>,” instead of those of the
translation in the Prayer-book, “The earth is
the Lord’s, and <em>all that therein is</em>.” On further
reflection, however, we are willing to think, that
while the two expressions are substantially the
same, there is just that shade of difference between
them that fits each for its respective position;
“the <em>fulness</em> of the earth” being most
appropriate to a commercial edifice,—“<em>all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
therein is</em>” to an industrial exhibition. However
this may be, it was to us, as may be supposed,
a gratifying circumstance that the first
sight that met our eye, on the very threshold, or
in the porch of the Palace of Industry, while
making our way to the opening ceremonial, was
that which assured us, that the words whose
import we had been endeavouring to illustrate
in “a book for the Exhibition,” were to lie beneath
the eye, and to address themselves to the
reason and the religious consciousness, of every
individual by whom it would be visited.</p>

<p>The recognition of God, in connexion with
the Exhibition, has always marked the references
to it of its most distinguished promoter.
The religious services on the day of the opening
were solemn and appropriate, and seemed at once
to crown and sanctify the work. “I confidently
hope,”—said his Royal Highness, Prince Albert,
at the banquet at the Mansion-house, in honour
of the undertaking,—“I confidently hope, that
the first impression which the view of this vast
collection will produce upon the spectator, will
be that of deep thankfulness to the Almighty for
the blessings which he has bestowed upon us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
here below.” It was a most impressive sight, on
the opening of the splendid spectacle thus anticipated,
to see some twenty-five or thirty thousand
people, all under the influence of a sentiment of
reverence, deeply calm, serious, and still, uniting
in an act of solemn devotion, while the highest
ecclesiastical dignitary in the land, standing by
the side of our august sovereign, who seemed to
bow in humility before the footstool of Him who
is “the King of kings,” expressed in a manner
the most appropriate, the “deep thankfulness”
of the vast assembly “for the blessings which
the Almighty has bestowed upon us,” and
acknowledged <em>Him</em> in the riches of nature and
the wonders of art with which the edifice was
filled! Every reader will probably have seen the
prayer to which we thus refer. It seems, however,
not inappropriate to give it a place in these
pages; the more so as its sentiments are so in
harmony with many of those we have been
attempting to express. It was as follows:</p>

<p>“Almighty and everlasting God, who dost
govern all things both in heaven and in earth,
without whom nothing is strong, nothing is
holy, accept, we beseech Thee, the sacrifice of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
praise and thanksgiving, and receive these our
prayers which we offer up unto Thee this day
on behalf of the kingdom and people of this
land. We acknowledge, O Lord, that Thou
hast multiplied on us blessings which Thou
mightest most justly have withheld. We acknowledge
that it is not because of works of righteousness
which we have done, but of Thy great
mercy, that we are permitted to come before
Thee with the voice of thanksgiving, and that
instead of humbling us for our offences, Thou
hast given us cause to thank Thee for Thine
abundant goodness. And now, O Lord, we
beseech Thee to bless the work which Thou
hast enabled us to begin, and to regard with
Thy favour our purpose of knitting together
in the bonds of peace and concord the different
nations of the earth; for with Thee, O Lord, is
the preparation of the heart in man. Of Thee
it cometh that violence is not heard in our land,
wasting nor destruction within its borders. It
is of Thee, O Lord, that nations do not lift up
the sword against each other nor learn war any
more; it is of Thee that peace is within our
walls and plenteousness within our palaces; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of Thee that knowledge is increased throughout
the world, for the spirit of man is from Thee, and
the inspiration of the Almighty giveth him understanding.
Therefore, O Lord, not unto us, not
unto us, but unto Thy name be all the praise. While
we survey the works of art and industry which
surround us, let not our hearts be lifted up that
we forget the Lord our God, as if our own power
and the might of our hands had gotten in this
wealth. Teach us ever to remember that all
this store which we have prepared cometh of
Thine hand and is all Thine own. Both riches
and honour come of Thee, and thou reignest
over all. In Thine hand it is to make great
and to give strength unto all. Now, therefore,
O God, we thank Thee; we praise Thee and
intreat Thee so to overrule <em>this assembly of many
nations</em>, that it may tend <em>to the advancement of
Thy glory, to the diffusion of Thy Holy Word</em>,
to the increase of general prosperity, by promoting
peace and goodwill among the different
races of mankind. Let the many mercies which
we receive from Thee dispose our hearts to serve
Thee more faithfully, who art the Author and
Giver of them all. And finally, O Lord, teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
us so to use those earthly blessings which Thou
givest us richly to enjoy, that they may not
withdraw our affections from those heavenly
things which Thou hast prepared for those that
love and serve Thee, through the merits and
mediation of Thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord,
to whom, with Thee and the Holy Ghost, be
all honour and glory.”</p>

<p>Prince Albert, after having, in the words
above quoted, expressed his hope respecting the
religious impression to be produced by the Exhibition,
proceeded to say that he trusted its
<em>second</em> lesson would be, “the conviction” that
the full enjoyment of the blessings of Providence
“could be realized only in proportion
to the help we are prepared to render to each
other; therefore only by <em>peace, love, and ready
assistance, not only between individuals, but
between the Nations of the earth</em>.”
The opening ceremonial of the first of May,
was an impressive commentary on this sentiment.
Within the same building were congregated
the representatives of many nations, and
people from every quarter of the globe. All
met and mingled together in perfect harmony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and seemed at once disposed to regard each
other with fraternal cordiality, and to be pervaded
and possessed by those sentiments which
are nourished and developed by the sunlight
of love. Everybody seemed bright; good-humoured;
happy; willing to please and to be
pleased! It was as if all the world had met
to celebrate the arrival or reign of universal
concord. The Palace of Industry was the
Temple of Peace. There were some military
uniforms, and a few soldiers here and there,
but no one thought of <em>fighting</em>! It was not
a battle,—it was not even a review. It was
not War when merely making a holiday; showing
himself off in his fine clothes to a gaping
multitude, and startling or amusing them by
his gigantic sport. A little boy—a child of
some five or six years old—while we were
all waiting for the coming of the Queen, got
away from his mother, or sister, ran into the
midst of the central crowd of dignitaries and
diplomatists, walked up the steps of the platform
on which was the chair of state, turned
round and stood looking about happy and
delighted, and then went back again to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
cover of the wing from which he had escaped!
The whole thing showed such a sense of <em>security</em>,—such
a feeling in the boy that there was
nothing to frighten him or to hurt him <em>there</em>,—that
he appeared like an impersonation of
the spirit of the place. He could not have
done or felt as he did in any assembly of
thirty thousand people that ever met in the
world before within the same walls. Such assemblages
there <em>have</em> been, and larger,—but
they met for purposes of cruelty and blood,—to
see men fight with beasts or with each
other. In the Crystal Palace is mirrored, we
trust, the dawn at least of the predicted day,
when “the wolf shall dwell with the lamb,
and the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
and the calf and the young lion and the fatling
together; <span class="smcapuc">AND A LITTLE CHILD SHALL
LEAD THEM</span>.”</p>

<p>Then there was to be seen for some time in
apparently friendly conversation, the Iron Duke
and the Lancashire cotton-spinner;—Wellington
and Cobden;—the man of war and the
apostle of peace! It was a suggestive sight.
The old soldier did a great and necessary work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
in his day. By his decisive stroke at the battle
of Waterloo, he terminated the protracted contentions
of Europe, and gave to us, as a nation,
a peace that has continued for thirty-five years.
<em>To that prolonged peace, we are in a great
measure indebted for the Exhibition of Industry</em>. It
would not have been improper, therefore, if, while
looking on the scene he had lived to witness,—a
scene that glorified his own eighty-second birthday,
and which was so different from all that he
had been familiar with in his youth,—it would
not have been improper if the military veteran
had felt that there was a connexion between
what he saw and what he had <em>done</em>. Than he,
we believe, there is no one more aware of
the horrors of war, or who would more bitterly
lament its necessity;—and though he can hardly
be expected to think Peace Societies the sole or
best defence of a nation, it is not to be doubted
that he would welcome “permanent and universal
peace,” and that he rejoices in an enterprise
that may help to secure it. <em>There they
were, then</em>,—two representative and typical men;—side
by side;—talking like brothers! There
they were;—the one the monument of a past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
age,—the other the personal prophecy of a
coming one. The one the chronicle of bygone
times, when nations thought themselves “natural
enemies,” and men knew of no arbiter
but the sword;—the other the advocate of
<em>another</em> arbitration, and the apostle of the industrial
intercourse of the world. The one was old,—the
other young. Let us hope that this, too,
was a type of <em>the principles</em> they respectively
represented;—that that of appealing and trusting
to the sword, is past its vigour and is
falling into decay,—while that of uniting by
mutual benefits, and of superseding the arguments
of brute force by those of reason and
love, is in its prime and manhood, and has
before it a long period of service. There are a
few specimens of cannon in the Exhibition, but
there are far more of agricultural instruments.
The time will come when none of the former
will find their place in any collection of the
works of “Industry,”—except, it may be, some
that shall be preserved as curious, though
sad and humiliating, relics of a former age.
“Weapons of war” are destined to disappear,
and to give place to the engine and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
compass,—the press and the tool-chest,—the plough
and the pruning-hook!</p>

<p>The incidents thus referred to, were felt to be
suggestive of many thoughts in harmony with
the sentiment last quoted from the speech of
Prince Albert. That sentiment, however, received
ampler illustration by what was seen on the
reading of the address of the Commissioners to
her Majesty,—by the closing language of that
address itself,—and by her Majesty’s reply. The
procession that approached the throne for the
presentation of the address, consisted not only
of Englishmen headed by the Consort of the
Sovereign, but of the foreign representatives of
twenty-six different nations, states, or kingdoms.
These, for the time, were all <span class="smcapuc">ONE</span>;—one body,—filled
with one sentiment, pervaded, as it were,
by one soul;—and they all united in uttering
through their common head, in the name of their
several countries, and in the presence of a multitude
almost as mixed and multifarious as themselves,
the following words:—</p>

<p>“It is our heartfelt prayer that this undertaking,
<em>which has for its end</em> the promotion of
all branches of human industry, and <em>the strengthening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of the bonds of peace and friendship</em> <span class="smcapuc">AMONG
ALL NATIONS OF THE EARTH</span>, may, by the blessing
of Divine Providence, conduce to the welfare
of your Majesty’s people, and be long remembered
among the brightest circumstances of your
Majesty’s <em>peaceful</em> and <em>happy reign</em>.”</p>

<p>It was a great thing to see the representatives
of Austria and Denmark, France and Belgium,
Prussia and Germany, Russia and Rome, Spain
and Portugal, Turkey and Tuscany, the United
States, Tunis, Sardinia, Greece, and of many
other lands, joining together in the expression
of a common hope, and the utterance of a united
prayer, that what they were doing might
“strengthen the bonds of peace and friendship
among all the nations of the earth;” and to
think, too, that they did this, not only in their
own names, and in those of their respective countries,
but in the name of <em>all</em> lands and peoples
in the world that might have any contribution in
the Exhibition, whether they had personal representatives
among the Commissioners or not. The
closing paragraph of her Majesty’s reply echoed
the closing sentiment of the address,—a sentiment
that came to her like an utterance from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
heart of universal humanity! It was an over-powering
sight, by the way,—that of one so
young, elevated in the midst of so vast a multitude,
and virtually receiving the homage of so
many nations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“A wondrous sceptre ’tis to bear;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Strange mystery of God which set</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Upon her brow yon coronet,—</div>
<div class="verse indent8">The foremost crown</div>
<div class="verse">Of all the earth on one so fair!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That chose her to it from her birth,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And bade <em>the sons of all the earth</em></div>
<div class="verse indent8"><em>To her bow down</em>.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Although the closing passage in her Majesty’s
speech is that to which we confine our attention,
as the speech itself is very brief, we give it
entire:</p>

<p>“I receive with the greatest satisfaction the
address which you have presented to me on the
opening of this Exhibition.</p>

<p>“I have observed with a warm and increasing
interest the progress of your proceedings in
the execution of the duties intrusted to you by
the Royal Commission; and it affords me sincere
gratification to witness the successful result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
your judicious and unremitting exertions in <span class="smcapuc">THE
SPLENDID SPECTACLE</span> <em>by which I am this day
surrounded</em>.</p>

<p>“<em>I cordially concur with you in the prayer,
that by God’s blessing this undertaking may conduce</em>
to the welfare of my people, and <em>to the
common interests of the human race</em>, by encouraging
the arts of peace and industry, <em>strengthening
the bonds of union among the nations of the
earth</em>, and promoting a friendly and honourable
rivalry in the useful exercise of those faculties
which have been conferred by a beneficent Providence
for the good and the happiness of
mankind.”</p>

<p>But we must draw to a close. There were
many other incidents on which we could willingly
linger, as illustrative of the views we had always
indulged of the character and tendencies of the
great experiment. The union in one edifice of
such an unprecedented number of human beings,
was itself a most imposing and magnificent
spectacle. The Queen appeared to feel this. As
she stood in a position to command a view of
the vast spaces of the building, all of which were
densely filled, she seemed impressed with a sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of awe at the sublime spectacle, and could not
help, even during the reading of the address of
the Commissioners, partially withdrawing her
attention from them, to steal a glance at “the
splendid spectacle by which she was surrounded.”
That spectacle, however, partook of the tender,
the beautiful, and the domestic even, as well as
the sublime. Into it, the Queen and her illustrious
Consort came, each leading by the hand
one of their children! Up and down, through
and amongst that mass of people, they moved
together in the same manner. Pomp and state
were in some degree laid aside, and the sovereign,
for the time, seemed to have become one with the
people. She was received with affection, as well
as loyalty; and appeared to enjoy and to acknowledge
her reception, not so much as a crowned
Queen, as a happy <em>woman</em>, an elated wife, and
a loving mother! It must have been the most
wonderful hour in the whole life of Prince Albert,—that
hour of the opening of the Exhibition!—intense
must have been the feelings with which
he looked on the realization of his great idea;
the end of so much anxiety; the commencement
of the harvest of so much hope! Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
was propitious. The sun in the heavens
shone down upon the scene with unwonted
brightness, as if He who “sits in the centre”
thereof, approved the undertaking and blessed
it from on high. There was not an accident
of any sort,—nothing for one moment to excite
alarm, to produce panic, or occasion apprehension
in the mind of the assembly. In spite of
the tens of thousands that filled it, in no part of
the edifice was there crack or strain, the indication
of weakness, or any sign of insecurity.
The outdoor crowds, instead of being disposed
to rudeness or riot, or capable of being excited
to tumult and rebellion (!), would seem to have
been more than usually pacific; a sort of restraint
appears to have been upon the worst
even of those who congregate on such occasions;
for, on the following day, there were no cases of
either quarrels or robberies such as ordinarily
attend state pageants and civic processions. The
royal Patrons of peace and industry retired
from the scene in which they had developed a new
phase of royalty, and read a new lesson to kings,
amid the benedictions and prayers of the multitude
with whom they had met and mingled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
They could not but retire happy and glad; grateful
to God for what they had witnessed, and
what they had done; and, in the fulness of their
emotions of devout thankfulness, like David,
perhaps, “returned home to bless their household.”
As it is not likely that anything will
occasion a <em>greater</em> gathering of the populace in
the parks, in connexion with the Exhibition, and
as the ceremony of the opening has given such
a glow of cheerfulness and confidence to the
public mind, it is to be hoped that the many
prophecies and prognostications of evil, which
some have indulged in, will now cease, and that
all will unite, by cordial sympathy with the great
object, and fervent prayer to Almighty God, to
seek the realization of those peaceful, patriotic, and
world-wide results, which many of the wise and
good hope that “the Great Exhibition” may be an
instrument in the hand of Providence to secure,
and which as Englishmen, Christians, and lovers
of our kind, we ought all constantly and earnestly
to pursue. In this way, every devout man may
help to hasten that anticipated <span class="smcapuc">FUTURE</span>, some
of the general characteristics of which we have
endeavoured to deduce from the Scriptural motto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
on the books of the Exhibition. Of that period
a pregnant and impressive type was presented
in the opening ceremonial, when, in the bearing
of all the nations of the earth, <em>representatively
present in the spacious edifice</em>, there rose up,—to
the praise and glory of that God, “<em>whose is
the earth and the fulness thereof, the world and
they that dwell therein</em>,” and to whom we are
indebted not only for “all the blessings of this
life,” but for “the means of grace, and the hope
of glory,”—the grand, solemn, <em>prophetic</em> song,—</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
